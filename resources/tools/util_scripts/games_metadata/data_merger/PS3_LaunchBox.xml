    <Name>1942: Joint Strike</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2008-07-24T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>1942: Joint Strike takes inspiration and influence from the 194X series of World War II-themed vertical shooters. The art, sound, and gameplay of the new game takes cues from the original 194X games, but stands out as its own unique entry. Gameplay resembles the classic 2D style that gamers expect, but the game utilizes a full 3D engine. Set in a World War II-themed locale, stages, vehicles, and weapons have the look and feel of WWII with some stylistic differences. The world in which 1942 takes place is not our own and the events that transpire are not historically accurate, nor are they intended to be. This is an alternate world where history and technology developed along their own paths. As a result, players jump into the cockpits of WWII-era aircraft to take on huge waves of incoming enemy fire, dodging explosions and missiles while challenging huge bosses at the end of each stage. New co-op "Joint Strike attacks" combine the powers of two aircrafts into a devastating barrage.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2012-11-29T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Developed by the same team behind Super Robot Wars Original Generation Gaiden, the game uses high-energy, dynamic action for the in-game battle sequences. According to current series producer Takenobu Terada, the game will use High-definition 2D sprites rendered over a 3D background. This effect was similarly used in the previous Super Robot Wars 64. The Twin Battle System from previous Original Generation installments, where two adjacent units can combine into a single squad, which can then attack simultaneously, will return. Two new features of the game were also revealed. The first one is the Maximum Break, which allows 4 units to attack simultaneously to the enemy.[1] The second is the ability slot system, which each pilot and mech gets three ability slots. Twin Units, one in game piece with two robots and two pilots, have a total of twelve slots. Default abilities were equipped when the game starts and defeating enemies allows players to obtain new ones. To activate an effect, the player needs three of the same abilities equipped to either the pilot or mech.[2] Usual features like the Weapon Equip System and Combination Attacks are also present</Overview>

    <Name>Ace Combat Infinity</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2014-05-20T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Ace Combat Infinity is set in an alternate timeline, in which Earth was ravaged by the "Ulysses Disaster". In 1994, a fictional asteroid collides with one of Jupiter's moons, 5254 Ulysses. This event sends about 10,000 meteors heading for Earth, all expected to impact the planet in five years' time. Faced with the prospect of extinction, the world's major superpowers build "Stonehenge", a network of anti-air railguns across the planet.[4] The meteor storm finally hits Earth in July 1999. While Stonehenge destroys enough of the inbound meteors to prevent human extinction, the remaining meteors still ravaged about 20% of the Earth's surface, destabilizing the economy and collapsing the world order.[4][5][6] The disaster hits Europe and Asia especially hard, forcing the nations to reorganize and create automated refugee zones. Twenty years later, the United Nations Forces finds itself fighting against terrorist organizations around the world. To better combat the terrorist threat, the UN hires Arrows Air Defense and Security, a private military company specializing in aerial warfare.[4]

The player character and silent protagonist, callsign "Reaper", is a rookie pilot employed by Arrows. Arrows assigns Reaper to the "Bone Arrow" squadron, which includes long-time pilot "Omega" and ace veteran "Viper". Part-way through the story, Bone Arrow becomes rivals with Ridgeback Squadron, a squadron of elite UNF pilots headed by leader "Slash" and his second-in-command, "Edge". The main antagonist forces are the Sons of Troia, a group of armed terrorists who later create an independent "Federation of USEA" or USEA Federation. Reaper's actions against the Sons of Troia and USEA soon make him a recognized mercenary ace pilot.[4]

Elements in the game, such as the Ulysses disaster, the Stonehenge superweapon and the rise of the USEA enemy faction (a new multinational military federation (the "United States of EurAsia"), rather than a fictional continent), are direct references to Ace Combat 4: Shattered Skies, but played on Earth instead of "Strangereal", the fictional planet setting of previous Ace Combat games.[7] Furthermore, the player character taking the role of a mercenary pilot of a private military company hired by the UN to keep the "post-Ulysses" world stable to regional dispute and terrorism attacks, is similar to the storyline of Ace Combat Zero: The Belkan War. Other elements, including fictional aircraft, names of locales and specific mission settings, reference elements of previous games in the franchise.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2016-04-22T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Aegis of Earth is set 50 years after a deadly event known as the “Silent Apocalypse”. This catastrophic event brought forth various creatures hellbent on destroying humanity. Accompanying the arrival of the creatures was a new element called the "Altenite", which stands as earth's last hope at survival. In the time prior to the game's beginnings, the surviving humans have built fortified cities which have since protected them from various assaults. However, with the approaching “Altered States” and continuous monster attacks, the inhabitants must prepare while continuing to expand and defend their cities.

Players take control of various urban areas, collecting taxes from residents, purchasing equipment, allocating resources and setting up the battlefield with units and artillery to protect the metropolis from the oncoming invasion. Once the battle has begun, waves of enemies will approach, with the player's responsibility being to use the weapons placed in the prior planning stage to defend their city.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2009-01-27T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>It is said that the one who becomes "Number One" will rule the world, wielding powers akin to a god. Someone becomes Number One by killing the previous Number One and taking his ceremonial headband. However, only the "Number Two" is allowed to challenge the Number One. Because of this, few people ever reach the Number One because the Number Two headband is constantly changing owners. Afro's father was the old Number One, until he was brutally killed by a gunman named Justice, an event witnessed by Afro as a child. Now an adult, Afro Samurai is the current Number Two and a master swordsman; he travels the road seeking revenge on Justice. Lengthy flashbacks interspersed throughout the story detail how Afro rose from frightened boy fleeing the death of his father, to master swordsman, and eventually to become the current "Number Two", while the story in the present deals with the adult Afro making his way to the mountain top keep of the "Number One" to duel Justice, while at the same time the mysterious cult known as the Empty Seven Clan sends various agents to kill Afro and take his Number Two headband.</Overview>

    <Overview>The story progresses through various points plotted on a map. By visiting each point, the player has to battle the creatures, complete a quest, visit a town or go through a conversation to advance through the storyline and open up more points.

Fighting plays out like a strategic RPG where each character has his/her own set of moves, but by moving each character to an appropriate square, you can chain characters together and pull off combos. After each round of combat, each character will regenerate AP and accumulate SP points. When enough SP points have been accumulated, characters can unleash special attacks.

The game includes dating sim elements through its "Soul Breed" system in which the player creates a new character by pursuing a relationship with a female character[6] as the game's storyline extends for five generations, each one having a different male protagonist. For the first four generations the protagonist marries one among three of his female companions and their son becomes the protagonist of the following generation who inherits stats and abilities from his parents.</Overview>

    <Name>Akiba's Trip: Undead &amp; Undressed</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2014-08-12T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Akiba's Trip: Undead &amp; Undressed is a 3D fighting brawler set in a modern day version of Japan's Akihabara district in Tokyo. It is the sequel to the 2011 PSP game Akiba's Trip. The protagonist is called Nanashi or 'Nameless', but this can be changed before starting the game. He is an otaku-type high school student who is on his way to a job interview. He does not remember what happens next, but he ends up strapped on an operating table where he is told that just like many others he has signed a contract with the Magaimono organization. This contract allowed them to turn him into a synthister, a vampire-like superhuman that feeds off other people's life energy. He needs to absorb the energy for Magaimono, but he is quickly rescued by a girl called Shizuku Tokikaze. She is a friendly synthister and her blood allows the protagonist to withstand his task and defend Akihabara instead.

He becomes a hunter to defeat the synthisters who prey on regular humans. Along with a band of freedom fighters Nanashi gets to roam the streets of Akihabara with over 100 shops modeled after the real life ones. Fights are done with brawling beat 'em up gameplay against one or more opponents in a small environment. Just like the protagonist himself the synthisters are sensitive to sunlight, so he needs to weaken the durability of their clothing with attacks until a part starts to blink and then there is an opportunity to tear off one or multiple parts of their clothing through a stripping mechanic, exposing them to sunlight which kills them. When multiple parts blink it is possible to perform chain strips. Rather than being a hentai title, the game presents the undressing in a quirky manner and does not contain full nudity. In the fighting system it is possible to attack using multiple stances and perform duo attacks with allies. Attacks are based on targeting the head and the upper and lower body. They can be strung together to form combos and there are many types of weapons, that can be upgraded multiple times, each with their own attacks, strengths and weaknesses. The character is also able to jump, avoid incoming attacks and counter blocks with special moves that break them.

Next to the fights a large amount of time is spent exploring the environment and completing missions to earn money. There are also many NPCs to talk to. Conversations often have dialogue trees and the answers not only affect the fights with synthisters, but also the relationships with the male and female cast of characters who can join or leave the protagonist's, with the option to pursue one of four love interests with their own endgame. A lot of communication is accessible through a smartphone, for instance to receive e-mails, check the Pitter social network, access the map or use the camera to take shots. Because of the large environment it is possible to fast travel between locations. The game contains many shops where items, weapons, clothing and food can be bought and sold.

    <Name>Alien Isolation: Nostromo Edition</Name>
    <Overview>Alien: Isolation is an action-adventure video game developed by the Creative Assembly and based on the Alien science fiction horror film series. It was published by Sega and originally released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and Xbox One on 7 October 2014. The game is set 15 years after the events of Ridley Scott's 1979 Alien film and follows Amanda Ripley, daughter of Alien protagonist Ellen Ripley, and her efforts to investigate the disappearance of her mother.

Unlike previous video game adaptations of the Alien franchise, Alien: Isolation places a strong emphasis on stealth and survival horror gameplay, requiring the player to avoid and outsmart a single alien creature over the course of the game. It was designed more in line with Scott's film as opposed to James Cameron's more action-oriented 1986 sequel Aliens, and features a similar lo-fi, 70s vision of what the future would look like. The game runs on an entirely new engine that was built from scratch to accommodate technical aspects like the game's atmospheric and lighting effects as well as the alien's behavioural design.

Upon release, Alien: Isolation received generally positive reviews from video game journalists and sold over two million copies in Europe and the US as of May 2015. Critics praised the game's retro-futuristic art direction and sound design, but criticized its story, characters, and voice acting. The game won several year-end awards, including Best Audio at the 2015 Game Developers Choice Awards and Audio Achievement at the 2015 British Academy of Film and Television Arts Awards.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2007-07-16T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>All-Pro Football 2K8 features a fictional league called the "All-Pro League", or 'APL'. The APL consists of 24 teams that are grouped into six divisions of four teams each. The league runs a sixteen-game schedule and holds a championship game at the end of the playoffs, similar to the NFL. Since the exclusivity deal the NFL has with EA only covers active players, 2K contracted the individual rights to over 240 retired NFL players to appear in the game. Even though there are no NFL teams in the game, the player can still create teams that resemble their NFL counterparts. A Create-a-Player feature allows the player to add in players that were not included in the roster, such as Hall of Fame linebacker Lawrence Taylor. While the game includes teams representing Los Angeles and Las Vegas, neither of which have an NFL team, there are no teams representing Buffalo, Kansas City, Baltimore, Jacksonville, Tennessee, Indianapolis, San Diego, or New Orleans—all cities with real NFL teams. Cleveland and Cincinnati are both represented by a team representing Ohio, and only one team represents the San Francisco Bay Area instead of two. Green Bay is not represented, but a city nearby, Milwaukee, is instead.</Overview>

    <Name>Alone in the Dark</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2008-06-24T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>It has been 83 years since Edward Carnby investigated the suicide of Jeremy Hartwood. Now he wakes up in an apartment in New York and is moments away from being shot by a group of bad guys. He doesn't remember much and as he looks into a mirror, a man looks back at him that isn't even near the age of 80. But as all hell breaks loose and mysterious forces tear through the building and the city itself, the question about his looks becomes one of many. To make things even worse, an old enemy decides to return in a search for a powerful stone. So for Carnby a race for survival begins and all signs point to Central Park.

Edward's mysterious journey is divided into eight episodes that can be played in chronological order or can be accessed directly from the main menu. Once in the game, the player controls Edward either in a 1st-person or a 3rd-person manner either by switching manually or depending on the situation and what item he uses. If he picks up a fire extinguisher for example, the player will be able to extinguish fires with it if he is in 1st-person mode. In 3rd-person mode it instead becomes a deadly weapon or a battering ram.

This is especially important since Edward won't find much ammunition for the pistols, shotguns and other weapons in the game. Instead he needs to be creative and use the items he finds or the environment for his advantage. Especially since most enemies can only be permanently killed by burning them, igniting a wooden chair at a nearby fire, or using a lighter and a can of hairspray are Edward's best bets to knock them out.

Fire plays an important role in the game at all times. If not extinguished, it will slowly burn through anything in the vicinity and spread until everything burnable has been reduced to a smoking pile of ash. This behavior can of course be useful to Edward if he for instance wants to get through a closed wooden door and has nothing heavy at hand to force his way.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2010-06-01T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Billed as an "espionage RPG," Alpha Protocol casts you in the role of secret agent Michael Thorton as he embarks on a series of international operations set in Rome, Moscow, Tai Pei, Saudi Arabia, and other exotic locales. From inside computer-equipped safe houses around the world, you'll converse with your handlers, glean intelligence, review dossiers, and receive new missions. What sets Alpha Protocol apart from traditional action games is the level of customization you have over your character and the options you have while interacting with others. Key role-playing features like dialogue trees, skill points, and equipment upgrades are included, with characters who will react in different ways based on your approach and reputation.

The action takes place from a third-person perspective as you complete objectives however you see fit, depending on the direction of your character. Stealth-oriented spies can complete the entire game without killing an enemy, while destructive types can bring out the body armor and heavy artillery. Action points can be assigned to an assortment of attributes, from stealth and pistols to sabotage and technical aptitude, which all lead to different skills. Cash earned by completing missions can also be spent in multiple ways, from powerful weapons on the black market to hiring mercenaries to purchasing various gun modifications for improving stats in areas like damage, accuracy, recoil, stability, and ammunition capacity.</Overview>

    <Name>Amplitude</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2016-04-05T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Amplitude features over 20 songs composed for an optimal beatmatching experience by Harmonix with contributions from Freezepop, Danny B, Jim Guthrie, and more. Many of the developers from the original game are actively working on the reboot.

The new Amplitude will be treated like a classic, sci-fi concept album. There is a narrative that runs through the game and surfaces in many ways through the visuals, music and song lyrics.

Players will speed down long, winding paths made up of the different musical elements of a song. Each track is differentiated with the musical sounds of synthesizers, drums, vocals, and bass. As players blast away the patterns of gems on these tracks, they release musical energy and recreate the hidden song within.

Gameplay remains easy to pick up and difficult to master. Achieving a top score will be a challenge and therefore worth bragging about via online leaderboards.

Amplitude supports up to four players locally. Challenge your friends and use devastating power-ups during frenetic multiplayer matches to secure your place at the top.</Overview>

    <Name>Amy</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2012-01-11T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Amy is a survival horror game where the player controls the woman Lana as she attempts to escort the 8-year old autistic girl Amy out of a city overrun with creatures and military. At the start of the game they are together in a train as Lana escorts her to a hospital after she is busted out of a shady research facility. The train suddenly derails and they end up in a dark and hostile environment. The game is played from a third-person perspective and the main goal is to make sure Lana keeps Amy out of harm's way. The creatures send out an infection, but Amy has an immunizing aura that prevents Lana from being infected as long as she keeps close. Therefore she walks around holding the girl's hand most of the game and they often need to sneak past hazards together. Lana is however also able to take out enemies with melee combat mechanics using sticks and crowbars, but in many situations that is not an option due to the number of opponents. Weapons also degrade over time. When Lana lets go of Amy, the infection gradually sets in and it causes the contamination sensor on her back to turn from green to yellow and red. It turns her skin pale and renders her vision hazy, but at certain points in the game it is necessary to sneak past creatures who then think she is one of their own.

As Amy's survival is vital for Lana, in many locations she is able to make her hide in closets or other spots when danger is lurking. The options to hide appear automatically when a viable location is nearby. Lana can also hide together with the girl or just by herself. All other control over Amy is also indirect. Lana can ask her to stay in a fixed place, call her to come over, make her turn on a lamp, or ask her to interact with an object in the environment. Amy has to hack into computers, crawl through small grates to access rooms, stand on elevators, and push buttons. There are also locks that can only be opened by collecting a specific DNA sample. These interactions are used extensively for environment-based puzzles. Later in the game Amy gets access to two psychic powers she can call upon; sending out a bubble that knocks down an opponent and a field that silences everything inside. These are activated by having Amy draw a glyph at specific locations around levels. The game consists of six chapters and saving is done automatically through checkpoints.</Overview>

    <Overview>The actual story mode of the game can be compared to an adventure game. The main - unnamed - character is a journalist, in search of the missing oceanographer William "Bill" Graber. Using a submarine called the Dolphin no.2 you explore the seas for clues.

The game takes place in Kisira Atoll, in Polynesia. An oceanographic research facility named Kisira Base is the starting point and where you always come back to, for supplies (such as batteries for sonar navigation buoys) and equipment.

Two scientists work at the base, the young and dreamy Jessica Porter and the conservative chief Robert Kemelman. Both assist you in solving mysteries, each in their own way. Jessica likes to believe fairytales and legends, while Robert usually comes up with a scientific explanation.

All the fish, animals and other discoveries are added to a database. Some fish can communicate and the player has to repeat the sounds made by a fish, using the four trigger buttons of the Sixaxis controller.

At all times, the unlocked area of the map is free to explore as you like.</Overview>

    <Name>Ar Tonelico Qoga: Knell of Ar Ciel</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-03-15T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Japan's Ar Tonelico role-playing series makes its first appearance on PlayStation 3 after two consecutive releases on PlayStation 2. The storyline follows a young man named Aoto in his quest to save a girl from being abducted by a mysterious organization. Aoto will be able to form a party with those he meets in his travels, which will take him to various towns and dungeons. 

The battle system is real-time based, similar to those of the Star Ocean games. Only one Reyvateil can be present in battle. The player controls one of the three Vanguard (support/attacking) members, and the AI controls the other two, though the player can change the character he/she is controlling at any time in battle. The Purge system is a key element, as it allows Reyvateils to use their high-level song magic. However, 'purging' also has importance for the Vanguard characters, as it allows them to use their best attacks.</Overview>

    <Overview>A plucky cast of female fighters duke it out on a battlefield with the help of their "Arcana" spirit (who adds to the character's attacks and defense) in this third entry in the all-girls fighting franchise. Arcana Heart 3 combines fast-paced aerial action with a unique cast for an extraordinary fighting experience!


Chaos and disorder are threatening to rip apart the very fabric of Japanese society as planar rifts appear throughout the country. It is suspected that the Drexler Institute, the instigator of the Great War many years ago and creator of the Divine Celestial Weapon, is somehow involved. In the midst of this confusion, a mysterious rumor arises, claiming the existence of wish-granting "Celestial Stones" within the chaotic planar rifts. As a result of these rumors, a number of individuals have converged on Japan in the hopes of obtaining one of these fabled stones – either to seal them away or to see for themselves if rumor is true. Each person has their own reasons for seeking these rare and valuable stones, and they won't let anyone stand in their way, be they foe ... or friend.</Overview>

    <Name>Assassin's Creed III: Liberation HD</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2014-01-14T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The game takes place in Louisiana near the end of the French and Indian War, where France's defeat caused the city of New Orleans to be taken over by the Spanish government. The citizens were upset over the transition from French to Spanish control and Spain's new occupation within the city. However, in 1765, the French governor Jean-Jacques Blaise d'Abbadie made a negotiation with Templar Rafael Joaquín de Ferrer to stay as governor of New Orleans. This plot was later uncovered by the Assassin Aveline de Grandpré, who infiltrated the governor's mansion and assassinated him.

Following this, de Ferrer made a deal with a man named Baptiste, who was hoping to defect from the Assassins to the Templar Order. Baptiste pretended to act as the recently deceased François Mackandal, as a ruse to attract followers to his cause. He planned to poison New Orleans' nobles and take control of smuggling operations within the Louisiana Bayou. However, his sole purpose was to force Agaté, Assassin and mentor to Aveline, out of hiding in the bayou. Aveline tracked him down, however, killing his followers and assassinating the false Mackandal.

In 1766, the Templar Antonio de Ulloa arrived in New Orleans, to serve as the Spanish governor. However, he left control of the area to French officials and allowed the French flag to remain over the city. Two years afterwards, he made strict trade restrictions and set up a covert slave-trading operation to transport slaves to a Templar worksite in Mexico, creating a rebellion among French officials and the citizens of New Orleans.

Agaté ordered Aveline to assassinate de Ulloa to eradicate Templar presence in New Orleans. Aveline ambushed de Ulloa's carriage and confronted the governor, who told her that slaves had been taken to Chichén Itzá. However, Aveline spared his life and let Ulloa leave the city, in return for a lens used to decode Templar documents and a map leading her to the Templar worksite in Chichén Itzá. Aveline's act of mercy destroyed any trust Agaté had in his student, as she had disobeyed his explicit orders.

Against her mentor's wishes, Aveline disguised herself as a slave bound for Mexico and made her way to the Templar worksite at Chichén Itzá. Whilst there, she came across a defiant slave who mentioned that Jeanne, Aveline's mother, was stationed in Chichén Itzá. Aveline investigated thoroughly and uncovered a page from Jeanne's diary and a map that lead to an artifact located inside a cenote. Upon exploring this cave system, she came across an ancient chamber filled with ruins from the First Civilization, along with a fragment of the artifact she was searching for, known as the Prophecy Disk.

Shortly after Aveline had acquired the artifact, de Ferrer, who was supervising the Templar worksite at Chichén Itzá, broke through into the chamber. However, Aveline overpowered his soldiers and killed him. At the end of the tunnels, she found Jeanne, who realized that her daughter was an Assassin and believed that Agaté had sent Aveline to kill her. She fled, though not before warning Aveline that the Prophecy Disk should never reach Agaté.

After two years of absence, Aveline returned to New Orleans to find that Spanish control was strong. After speaking to fellow Assassin Gérald Blanc, she learned that someone was bribing Spanish soldiers. Upon investigating, Aveline discovered that a man by the name of Vázquez was using Spanish soldiers to seize control of the bayou and take control of the bayou's smuggling operations, which would eventually lead him to discover the location of Agaté. Believing him to be the "Company Man", the head Templar of Louisiana, who de Ferrer mentioned in Chichén Itzá, Aveline immediately hurried to Agaté's hut to warn him of the threat posed by Vázquez's soldiers. Agaté told her to use the power of voodoo to spook the Spanish soldiers into abandoning their mission. Using her blowpipe, Aveline poisoned enough of Vázquez's soldiers so that the rest believed they were cursed and fled the bayou.

Aveline returned to Chichén Itzá and made peace with her mother, who directed her to a canoe inside another cenote. Aveline navigated her way through the cenote and retrieved the final piece of the Prophecy Disk. She offered to bring her mother back to New Orleans, but Jeanne decided to stay behind to take care of the community, which was now rid of Templar influence.

Aveline returned to New Orleans, continuously working to free slaves in the city. Her stepmother, Madeleine de l'Isle, became aware of her work and asked her to help a slave named George escape north. Aveline found a safe passage through the bayou for George to leave through. Whilst escorting him through the swamp, she met with her smuggler allies Élise Lafleur and Roussillon, helping them to deliver supplies to American patriots who were fighting in the American Revolutionary War.

Vázquez attempted to stop Aveline and her allies by sending Spanish soldiers their way, but failed. Aveline defeated Vázquez's soldiers and ensured George and the supplies reached their destination. After returning to the city, Aveline dressed herself in a noblewoman outfit and attended a governor's ball, in hopes that Vázquez would be there. After speaking with several guests, she located Vázquez and asked him to dance. Using her charm, she managed to assassinate him. However, to her surprise, Vázquez revealed that he was not the Company Man.

Aveline next spoke to Gérald, who told her that a Templar working for the Company Man had been found on the New York frontier. Aveline learned that the Templar was Officer Davidson, a Loyalist soldier of the Ethiopian Regiment. Aveline reached the New York frontier in 1777 and met Connor, a half Mohawk, half British Assassin fighting the Templars during the American Revolution.

Aveline and Connor made their way through the frontier to a fort where Officer Davidson was located. Connor distracted the guards and allowed Aveline to slip inside the fort. She confronted Officer Davidson, shocked to learn that he was actually George, the escaped slave she had helped flee north. He attempted to escape, but Aveline managed to shoot his carriage and prevent his departure. From him, Aveline finally discovered the identity of the Company Man: Madeleine de L'Isle, her stepmother. Upon returning to Louisiana, Aveline hurried to her family's mansion and confronted her stepmother. Madeleine revealed to Aveline that she had secretly manipulated her life, preparing her for induction into the Templar Order, as she believed that they shared a common goal.

Afterwards, Aveline traveled to the bayou and met with Agaté, informing him of Madeleine's identity as the Company Man. Agaté was unable to accept his failure and believing that Aveline had sided with the Templars, attacked her. Aveline overpowered him and attempted to convince him to leave Louisiana for his own safety, but Agaté could not live with the humiliation and instead chose to dive to his death.

Aveline decided to infiltrate the Templars and eradicate it from within. Upon returning to New Orleans, she made her way to the Saint Louis Cathedral and gave Madeleine Agaté's necklace to show her allegiance. Following this, she was inducted into the Templar Order by her stepmother. Aveline then gave her the two halves of the Prophecy Disk, which Madeleine placed on an altar and added another piece to hold the two fragments together. However, she could not make sense of the scrambled messages within. Aveline saw this as her moment to strike and reclaim the Prophecy Disk. She eliminated all the Templars inside the cathedral and assassinated Madeleine.

Now alone inside the cathedral, Aveline stepped up to the altar where the Prophecy Disk had been placed.

    <ReleaseDate>2010-09-28T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The Alchemist of Arland is a classically styled role-playing game, set in a realm of alchemy and magic, with turn-based battles and complex character development. Based on a long-running Japanese series, it is the fourth console game in developer Gust's Atelier series to be released in North America, and the first developed for PS3. The game's graphics employ cel-shaded 3D characters and finely detailed 2D backgrounds, to create the effect of playing through a high-definition anime feature. Combat plays out with each character and enemy making its attack in turn. Positioning is not important in the abstract battles, but using the most effective attacks at the right times, against creatures with different elemental strengths or weaknesses, can make a significant difference in a close fight. The game's alchemy interface allows players to combine quest rewards and found objects into tools, armor, and weapons of great power or specific use. The game's ultimate challenge is to create the rarest object in the world - an object perhaps powerful enough to save the realm, or destroy it -- using exceptional ingredients and alchemistic expertise gathered throughout the adventure. The plot plays out as a series of 12 great tasks, each of which must be accomplished within a limited amount of game time, in order to proceed to the next. The story branches, according to the player's role-playing decisions, to multiple possible endings.</Overview>

    <Overview>Atelier Shallie: Alchemists of the Dusk Sea closes the final chapter in the Atelier Dusk series and is the incarnation of features developed based on community feedback of the previous Dusk titles and new systems that combines ease of entry for newcomers, with the choice to advance gameplay for long-time fans. The battle system will incorporate strategy and speed, the time management system will be free from restrictions allowing for unlimited play time and Alchemy RPG fans can look forward to a straightforward menu in the engaging Synthesis system. In Atelier Shallie: Alchemists of the Dusk Sea players chose to play as either the reserved, mission-focused Shallistera, daughter of a tribal leader who embarks on voyage to find a cure for her ailing father or ambitious, energetic Shallotte, who has been struggling to bring success to the alchemy workshop since the passing of her father. While their personalities and appearance are drastically different, they both share the nickname "Shallie" and uncover the reasoning why along each of their journeys- the dual main character system has been improved with separate stories and multiple endings for Shallistera and Shallotte. For the first time in the Atelier series, Atelier Shallie: Alchemists of the Dusk Sea will include a 360 degree camera, giving players more freedom as they explore a vast world map that has expanded greatly with many new environments that evolve based on how the player progresses. In the new Quest system players can either take on only assignments necessary to progress the game or earn more points engaging in additional, more challenging quests.</Overview>

    <Overview>Join the super-powerful undisputed goddess, Chou-Chou, as she continues her quest to conquer the twelve Zodiac worlds and make everyone and everything her peon.

Created by Compile Heart, the developers of Fairy Fencer F and the Agarest and HyperDimension Neptunia series , Mugen Souls Z features free-roaming world maps and a brilliantly flexible turn-based battle system. With the ability to do billions of hit points worth of damage, a level cap of 9999 and some brilliant anime-style artwork, Mugen Souls Z is a game that will satisfy even the most hardcore JRPG player.

Twelve worlds corresponding to the signs of the zodiac were created long ago by the ultimate gods and now a certain “something” capable of destroying each of the worlds is preparing to awaken from a long sleep.

Chou-Chou and the gang return in this brand-new S-RPG sequel with a new story and even cuter, super-powerful, godly action and adventure!

    <Name>Baja: Edge of Control</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2008-09-22T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Baja: Edge of Control is an off-road racing game based on the real-life Baja 1000 race series held in California. The tracks are set in a desert environment and there's over 1000 miles of route to explore. In the main career mode, the idea is to start at the bottom class of off-road racing with a VW Beetle. By performing well in races, players earn prize &amp; sponsorship money and experience points to buy better machines and unlock higher classes. In order to secure the sponsorship money, their logos must still be on the car at the end of the race, so too much damage to the car will result in the player not getting paid. The vehicles can be tuned and modified to increase performance.

There are five different race modes; circuit which is a standard race where you do a few laps of a track against opponents, rally which a point to point time-trial, hill climb which as it suggests is drive up a steep hill, and then back down, open class where different categories of car race against each other with a handicap system in place to disadvantage the more powerful ones and Baja which is an endurance race lasting between 250-1000 miles. The Baja mode races can last up to several hours.</Overview>

    <Name>Bakugan: Battle Brawlers</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-10-20T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>One day the player's character meets Dan Kuso, one of the Battle Brawlers, who teaches him the rules in a fight against Shuji. (you get a Serpenoid, a Juggernoid, and a Saurus that match the attribute you chose at the start of the game). After going to the local store and meeting Alice, who suggests the player should battle with other brawlers in the park to earn BP (Bakugan Points, the game's currency) a strange Bakugan called Leonidas falls from the sky, who is now the new best friend of the player. (Leonidas' attribute depends on what attribute you chose). Leonidas is an unknown and aggressive Bakugan that was created by all the hate and anger of the lost Bakugan trapped in the Doom Dimension. In several fights the player will meet a lot of people but at the same time a Darkus user, whose name is Marduk, decides to rule over all Bakugan together with Vladitor, another Bakugan that suddenly appears.

Right after Naga got the Silent Core, the seals that held Vladitor captive in the Doom Dimension suddenly broke and he escaped from the Doom Dimension. At the end of a tournament when Dan makes the player an official Bakugan Battle Brawler, Marduk is revealed to have allied with Hal G, Masquerade and Naga in order to defeat the Battle Brawlers and rule over the worlds and the Bakugan. The player must win the Ultimate Battle Tournament, defeating also Dan, Runo, Marucho, Julie, Shun, Masquerade, and a 1-on-1 showdown with Omega Leonidas and Battle Axe Vladitor. After the player wins, both Vladitor and Leonidas disappear, saying they have only little power left after the brawl. Later, the player discovers that Vladitor gave Leonidas his remaining power, saying he deserved it, leaving Leonidas to assume that Vladitor "wasn't all bad". The game ends with the player throwing Leonidas in the air shouting, "Bakugan brawl!".</Overview>

Story
Batman: Arkham Asylum features an original story penned exclusively for the game by famous Batman author and five-time Emmy award winner, Paul Dini, whose credits include "Lost" season one and "Batman: The Animated Series." As the game begins Batman is personally delivering his nemesis, The Joker, to the asylum at Arkham Island, but he is uneasy. Although the Arkham asylum is well fortified, he has a nagging feeling that all is not well, which proves to be the case when seconds after turning The Joker over to the guards, the master criminal breaks free of his captors. Even more surprising than this quick turn of events is the revelation that it was never The Joker's intent to escape the vault-like facility, but instead to trap Batman there. Surrounded by an asylum full of dangerous criminals, many of which he put there and all at the beck and call of the Joker, can Batman survive and discover what is behind the Joker's intricate plot?

Gameplay
In Batman: Arkham Asylum players strap on the gadget-heavy utility belt of the Caped Crusader. Gameplay here is a combination of both the knuckle crunching rush of hand to hand combat as you take on the hordes of thugs that infest Arkham Asylum, and stealth gameplay in which you must dispatch individuals from the shadows. Players can expect an engrossing single player campaign in which Batman continually moves forward to face the henchmen, bosses and traps that The Joker has set for him. With regards to opponents, in addition to The Joker who you will hear more than you see, the dark walls of Arkham also hold familiar villains from the the Batman criminal universe including Harley Quinn, Victor Zsasz and Killer Croc, that you will have to deal with, but don't expect a one-dimensional experience. As players progress from environment to environment within Arkham they will have to use varying combinations of muscle, detective skills, gadgetry and a certain degree of light RPG-like leveling of Batman's skills, arsenal and physical characteristics to survive and discover what The Joker's underlying scheme is.

In addition to the story-driven single player campaign Arkham Asylum also contains various additional play modes. These include an arcade styled combat mode where players accumulate points by engaging hordes of thugs in a hand to hand slugfest across a series of maps, in which Batman's physical strength and agility play a major role. The key here is to chain together as many attacks as possible due to the fact that with each successful combo players increase the point multiplier associated with their actions. The game also features a time-based stealth mode where players must hone their ability to strike silently from the shadows. This gameplay, referred to as 'Invisible Predator' utilizes the Dark Knight's skill with gadgets like the grapple tool, batarang and explosives. These allow for vertical/horizontal mobility, the ability to quickly strike from above and at a distance and to take out enemies and create distractions, even through walls. But remember that Batman works solo and is not superhuman. Your enemies will congregate around trouble areas and work as a team against you, so you must be silent, plan your attacks wisely, strike quickly and discover the value of encouraging fear within enemies.

    <Name>Batman: Arkham City: Game of the Year Edition</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2012-03-29T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Batman: Arkham City is a 2011 action-adventure video game developed by Rocksteady Studios and released by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 video game consoles, and Microsoft Windows. Based on the DC Comics superhero Batman, it is the sequel to the 2009 video game Batman: Arkham Asylum and the second installment in the Batman: Arkham series. It was released worldwide for consoles, beginning in North America on October 18, 2011, with a Microsoft Windows version following on November 22.

Written by veteran Batman writer Paul Dini with Paul Crocker and Sefton Hill, Arkham City is based on the franchise's long-running comic book mythos. In the game's main storyline, Batman is incarcerated in Arkham City, a huge new super-prison enclosing the decaying urban slums of fictional Gotham City. He must uncover the secret behind the sinister scheme, "Protocol 10", orchestrated by the facility's warden, Hugo Strange. The game's leading characters are predominantly voiced by actors from the DC Animated Universe, with Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill reprising their roles as Batman and the Joker, respectively. The game is presented from the third-person perspective with a primary focus on Batman's combat and stealth abilities, detective skills, and gadgets that can be used in both combat and exploration. Arkham City expands Batman's arsenal of gadgets and combat attacks and offers a more open world structure, allowing the player to complete side missions away from the primary storyline.

The game received critical acclaim, particularly for its narrative, character and world designs, soundtrack, and Batman's combat and navigation abilities. It was tied for the highest-rated video game of 2011 according to review aggregator Metacritic, and was the recipient of several awards including: Game of the Year, Best Action Game, Best Action Adventure Game, Best Adventure Game, and Best Original Score from various media outlets, and it is considered one of the best games ever made. Arkham City was followed by several additional releases: a spin-off mobile game, Batman: Arkham City Lockdown, on December 7, 2011; a Game of the Year edition containing all of the game's downloadable content on May 29, 2012; and Wii U and OS X versions in November and December 2012, respectively. A successor, Batman: Arkham Origins, was released in October 2013, and a narrative sequel, Batman: Arkham Knight, was released in June 2015.</Overview>

    <Overview>Game modes include practice, regular competition (where the player can select or deselect each event, for men and women), random events, Decathlon or Heptathlon and of course, the Olympics. While in previous games the Olympics were usually just a set of events, in Beijing 2008 they are much more complex, and feature a game where the player must complete a number of challenges each day with the difficulty level and number of necessary successes increasing progressively. While in the other modes there is a slight slowdown during the technical parts of the events, in Olympic the player must assign points to it, and trigger when required. The player also needs to assign points to other key areas, such as speed, technique or accuracy. Failing to reach the goal for the day forces the player to load the game and try again.</Overview>

    <Name>BioShock Infinite</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2013-03-26T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>BioShock® Infinite is a first-person shooter like you’ve never seen. Just ask the judges from E3 2011, where the Irrational Games title won over 75 editorial awards, including the Game Critics Awards’ Best of Show. Set in 1912, players assume the role of former Pinkerton agent Booker DeWitt, sent to the flying city of Columbia on a rescue mission. His target? Elizabeth, imprisoned since childhood. During their daring escape, Booker and Elizabeth form a powerful bond -- one that lets Booker augment his own abilities with her world-altering control over the environment. Together, they fight from high-speed Sky-Lines, in the streets and houses of Columbia, on giant zeppelins, and in the clouds, all while learning to harness an expanding arsenal of weapons and abilities, and immersing players in a story that is not only steeped in profound thrills and surprises, but also invests its characters with what IGN called “Emotional ties (that) will continue to set the bar in gaming.”</Overview>

The game was released on July 7, 2010 on Xbox 360 as a downloadable title, and was released on Microsoft Windows on July 14. The game was also released on October 26, 2010 for the PlayStation 3.

Zombie was planning to make Blacklight a multimedia franchise that would include the video game, a feature film, and a trilogy of comic books, however the company became defunct on January 8, 2015. The idea was concepted by Zombie executives which later pitched the idea to several film and comic book production companies.

Fox Atomic's comic subsidiary, Fox Atomic Comics, was also to be creating the Blacklight comics, but after the closing of Fox Atomic, the trans-media rights have been purchased by Imagine Entertainment.[1] The film, comic books, and game will not share the same storylines, but tell different stories in the Blacklight universe at different time periods.[2]</Overview>

    <Name>Bladestorm: The Hundred Years' War</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2007-11-06T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Bladestorm: The Hundred Years' War has players take control of a mercenary for hire during the legendary English / French conflict. Lead soldiers, warriors and fellow swords for hire into battle on horseback or on foot, fighting alongside Joan of Arc or the King of England as you strive to become the mercenary champion and gain fame and fortune during these dark times.

The gameplay takes place in a 3rd-person perspective and takes the form of an action / RPG of sorts. The 'central hub' of the game is a local bar where the player attempts to find jobs that will increase his or her wealth and reputation, as well as dealers that will allow the player to change weaponry or buy more troops to fight alongside them. This hub area also serves as a meeting place for characters from the game world and the player may gleam information from gossip heard that will help them later in-game. Talking to the barman within will present a roster of missions available, the length of that particular campaign and the reward for success - these can take place on either the English or French side (you cannot ally with just one faction). Selecting one of these missions will take you to the battlefield.

The main game itself is broken down into what first appears to be a strategy sort of game in which the player is shown which territories they have to take to successfully complete the mission - however any strategic element ends here. They can then select which 'home camp' to start from. Once this is chosen they are presented with a battlefield (similar in respects to dynasty warriors). The main objective is to make their way to the castle / village to be taken and successfully seize it from the occupying troops. battling with any enemy troops they encounter along the way.

The player can command a number of differing types of combatants, from archers to footsoldiers to horseback, and later on in-game camel and elephant riders. Battles are a simple hack and slash affair, with the player attempting to clear the area of enemy troops. Once this has been achieved a base commander will appear at the base under siege. Beat this commander and the player will have seized the territory and completed the mission. Extra fame can be achieved from beating in combat the VIP enemies found throughout the mission. This in turn will also yield treasure for the player, some of which is collectible throughout the game.

As such, Bladestorm has no end - the player will continue to fight battles as they progress (This is after all the Hundred Years' War!), but there is a story arc within the game to be completed, and the amount of missions - although very similar can give players a lot game content to keep them happy.</Overview>

    <Overview>The first hi-res 2D fighter from the creators of the Guilty Gear series! BlazBlue is a traditional 2D fighter where two characters participate in a duel. The story of the game involves dissent and destruction among a powerful council, known unofficially as "the Library," which controls a great power that once saved humanity, but which now wields its power in protective, some say repressive, ways. 

A round is called a "rebel" and one match can consist of one to five "rebels". To win a round, one player must either incapacitate the other by inflicting damage through various attacks to reduce their opponent's health to zero or by having more remaining health than their opponent after the clock runs out. Every character has a weak, medium and strong attack. Also every ones has a "unique" technique, called a Drive attack, which is different for each character.</Overview>

    <Name>Bleach: Soul Resurrection</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-08-02T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The afterlife adventures of reluctant Soul Reaper Ichigo Kurosaki make their high-def video game debut in the PlayStation 3-exclusive Bleach: Soul Resurrección. Gamers can role-play through re-creations of their favorite plotlines from the Bleach comics and cartoon series, or seek out new side-adventures in the freely roamed game world, stocked with random encounters and fan-friendly details. Cel-shaded graphics add interactive depth, in the anime's distinctive visual style. In addition to Ichigo, gamers may play through the mission-driven stories of 20 other characters from the popular manga and animated series. By choosing which new powers and abilities to unlock, characters can be custom-developed as they earn experience. The combat-centric action involves super-human swordplay and supernatural powers, and battles sometimes develop Dynasty Warriors-style odds, as the player's lone hero must aggressively fend through deluges of enemy opponents. The game's Mission Mode offers a goal-oriented alternative to the Story Mode's character-based campaigns.</Overview>

    <Name>Borderlands 2 Deluxe Vault Hunter's Edition</Name>
    <Overview>Gearbox sends gamers back to the Borderlands for a shooter-adventure sequel of high-velocity combat and custom character development. The first-person action plays out in dystopian outpost environments on the original game's planet of Pandora, five years later, as a greedy industrialist called Handsome Jack seeks to weed out the local populace through a series of gladiator matches. Players choose from four new character types, each with three branches of specialized development in the game's RPG-like experience system. Experience comes with kills and quest completions.

Expanding on the original game, Borderlands 2's gun system can create millions of different computer-generated weapons, as well as shields and equipment enhancements. Non-player characters are more expressive, and quest outcomes have more influence on the game world. In addition to the dusty, desert settings of the first adventure, the sequel visits a number of new Pandora environments, including the merciless frozen tundra where the revenge-driven plotline begins. Online, over a local network, or in split screen, the game's co-op mode allows a second player to freely join and drop out of a game in session.

The "Deluxe Vault Hunter's Collectors Edition" offers players the full game, an authentic Marcus Kincaid bobblehead doll, a hardbound art book, a set of four collectible stickers, a map of Pandora, and DLC including a digital comic.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2014-05-09T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>In the action/RPG Bound by Flame, you are a mercenary possessed by a flame demon in an ambitious Dark Fantasy universe. As a victim of this demonic influence, players will have to choose between the powers offered by this evil or rejection of the demonic influence in order to develop heroic talents instead. Dangers, and enemies becoming more terrifying and fearsome in battle, will be temptations to acquire more power by giving up part of the hero's soul to the demon. Progression of the demonic influence will be reflected by the transformation of the hero's body.

Through its different chapters, Bound by Flame offers many quests around a primary, epic adventure. Depending on the choices made by the player and the influence of the demon, some chapters will offer different scenarios and a different experience, adding important replayability to the game. If the player begins the game knowing only the basics of combat, fire magic, and assassination, he will be able to specialize by unlocking and improving many skills and powers, through three different skill trees.</Overview>

    <Name>Braid</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-11-12T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Braid is a platform and puzzle video game developed by Number None, Inc. The game was originally released in August 2008 for the Xbox 360's Xbox Live Arcade service. Ports were developed and released for Microsoft Windows (April 2009), OS X (May 2009), PlayStation 3 (November 2009), and Linux (December 2010).

The basic story elements unfold as the protagonist, Tim, attempts to rescue a princess from a monster. Text passages laid throughout the game reveal a multifaceted narrative, giving clues about Tim's contemplations and motivations. The game features traditional aspects of the platform genre while integrating various powers of time-manipulation. Using these abilities, the player progresses by finding and assembling jigsaw puzzle pieces.

Jonathan Blow designed the game as a personal critique of contemporary trends in game development. He funded the three-year project with his own money. Webcomic artist David Hellman drew the artwork, which underwent several iterations until it satisfied Blow's vision. A preliminary version of Braid without the final artwork won the "Innovation in Game Design" award at the 2006 Independent Games Festival; the final version received additional accolades. The game received highly positive reviews from critics, eventually becoming the highest critically rated title on Xbox Live. Some reviewers, however, criticized the game's price relative to its length.

Braid has been seen as a keystone title in the growth of indie game development since its 2008 release, and Jonathan Blow and its production was documented in the film Indie Game: The Movie.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2012-06-19T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Brave is an adventure game adaptation based on the film of the same name developed by Behaviour Interactive and published by Disney Interactive Studios. Actress Kelly Macdonald, who voiced Mérida in the film, reprised her role for the video game. This game was originally going to be published by THQ, but was published by Disney Interactive Studios instead.

The gameplay consists of single player and local co-operative play.[2] The first player controls Mérida while in co-op mode a second player can take control of a will-o'-the-wisp. Gameplay also features puzzles, which are to be solved with the help of the triplets, and Queen Elinor, who is playable in her bear form in arena fights. Different levels of the game can be accessed from the location called "Ring of Stones". Players can use different types of charms (fire, earth, air, and ice) to add elemental effects to her arrows and sword attacks when fighting enemies, some of which are vulnerable to a certain element.

The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game are compatible with the PlayStation Move and Kinect motion control peripherals, respectively. This feature comes in the form of an "archery range" m</Overview>

    <Overview>From the mind of Tim Schafer (Psychonauts, Grim Fandango) comes Brutal Legend, the ultimate heavy metal action game starring Jack Black (School of Rock, Tenacious D). You are heavy metal roadie Eddie Riggs, hurled back in time to the mythical Age of Metal when the world was formed and ruled by the power of Rock! Armed with a broadaxe, a guitar, and a big block V8 you set off on an epic quest to assemble an army of headbangers, hotrods, barbarians, demonic dominatrix and the undead. With the wings of a demon and the power of a Rock God, you must lead humanity in an epic war against its barbaric overlords, and carve your name forever into the Brutal Legend. In Brutal Legend, you'll roam through a massive open-world born from the hell fires of heavy metal. In this world you can rev up any vehicle, rock its weapons, and crush the enemies of metal. You'll also learn to devastate with your guitar, playing face-melting solos that actually melt the faces of your enemies, command savage armies, bang skulls in hand-to-hand combat, and rise like a bat out of hell to command blood-drenched action from above. As if that wasn't enough, you can slay your friends and foes online, then play guitar licks on their graves! Of course, Brutal Legend is only complete with the most ultimate heavy metal soundtrack ever assembled in a game.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2011-02-22T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Bulletstorm brings new furor to first-person shooter action thanks to its signature 'kill with skill' gameplay. The game tells the story of a futuristic confederation protected by an elite band of mercenaries: Dead Echo. When Dead Echo members Grayson Hunt and Ishi Sato learn they've been working for the wrong side, they're betrayed by their commander and exiled to the far reaches of the galaxy. In Bulletstorm, Grayson and Ishi find themselves surrounded by hordes of mutants and flesh eating gangs in an abandoned paradise. They have two objectives: get off the planet alive, and exact revenge on the man who sent them there.

Players step into the role of Grayson Hunt complete with an arsenal of over-the-top combat moves and outrageously large guns. Bulletstorm's array of distinct 'skillshots' produces unprecedented levels of frantic gameplay and yell-inducing satisfaction. The skillshot system rewards players for inciting mayhem in the most creative way possible. The more insane the skillshot, the more points players collects to upgrade their character and unlock weapons, which then allows them to execute even more creative moves and exaggerated skillshots.</Overview>

    <Name>BurgerTime: World Tour</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-11-15T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>BurgerTime: World Tour is a reworking of the 1982 game BurgerTime in a 3D environment. It is a platform game where players control burger chief Peter Pepper as he transverses international worlds creating burger piece by piece across its city-scaping levels including New York, Paris, Tokyo, and Mexico. The objective is to complete a set amount of burgers in a level by walking over its various ingredients and condiments such as patties, cheese, tomatoes and buns from high platforms all the way to the burgers already assembled at the very bottom of the stages.

Levels are shaped in a circular form as a theater-in-the-round setting and they rotate as the player moves left or right, keeping the main character in the center of the screen. Movement between levels is done with ladders and platform while enemies such as eggs, hot dogs, and pickles need to be avoided. They can be sent down by dropping ingredients on them and they can also temporarily be stunned by blasting pepper. A single hit and the main character dies. Peter Pepper also has various power-ups and weapons at his disposal, including a spatula which will knock enemies who follow him around the stages. The game has both split-screen and online multiplayer.</Overview>

In November 2007, Buzz! Junior: Jungle Party won a British Academy Children's Award BAFTA for best Children's videogame.[3]

A PSP version of the game was released in November 2010.[2]

The game was rated 3+ in Europe, but was rated E10+ in North America for Crude Humor and Mild Cartoon Violence.</Overview>

    <Overview>With the world as their playground, players will explore a vast expanse of mountains and valleys with unprecedented choices in direction never before seen in a Cabela's hunting game. Players can climb an area to get a better angle for the shot but risk being spotted, or they can take a low elevation route with poor visibility but plenty of concealment. Nature doesn't always wait for you to make the first move as the dynamic weather and natural hazards make the hunt even more challenging. The challenge doesn't end there. Cabela's Big Game Hunter 2012 ups the ante with the most realistic animals ever seen in the Cabela's series. Every animal's unique movement gives clues on what the animal will do next. In order to bag the trophies, players will have to avoid detection through cunning, skill, and deception. They must also utilize master hunting skills such as advanced stalking techniques so they can quickly move through cover and close in on their targets.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2014-03-25T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Cabela's Big Game Hunter: Pro Hunts is a 2014 hunting simulation video game developed by Slovakian game developer Cauldron Ltd. and published by Activision Publishing, Inc. for the Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Wii U and Xbox 360.

The player has to complete objectives such as hunting an animal with various weapons (rifles, bow, shotgun) in order to progress in the campaign. The player has access to four different hunting areas, all in North America which is divided into the Southeast, Northeast, Southwest and Northwest. Different areas have different animals which can be hunted. Some animals, such as moose, bears, and boars, will charge if surprised, angered, startled, or threatened.

Special animals which can be regarded as game bosses have to be hunted also in a special way to unlock the next hunting area. The game bosses are:

Hogzilla — a huge, ill-tempered wild boar.
Pincushion — a white-tailed deer who has been shot several times before and has always been able to live another day.
Northeast

Double Shovel — a trophy caribou.
Radar — a moose with a keen sense of hearing.
Southwest

Airplane — a pronghorn with very wide horns.
The Grey Ghost — a wary and very large racked mule deer.
Northwest

King — a very skittish roosevelt elk
Scarface — a very mean grizzly bear who has a taste for moose and a big scar on his face.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2009-12-03T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Call of Duty: Classic is the 2009 console port from the original PC release with up-scaled resolution with some HD content. Though online multiplayer is only 8 players opposed to the 64 players on PC. 

As a first-person shooter, Call of Duty places the player in control of an infantry soldier who makes use of various authentic World War II firearms in combat. Each mission features a series of objectives which are marked on the heads-up display's compass; the player must complete all objectives to advance to the next mission. The player can save and load at any time, rather than the checkpoint system utilized in later Call of Duty games. 

The player has two primary weapon slots, a handgun slot and can carry up to ten grenades. Weapons may be exchanged with those found on the battlefield dropped by dead soldiers. Unlike later Call of Duty games, the first allows the player to toggle between different firing modes (single shot or automatic fire). Call of Duty was one of the early first-person shooters to feature iron sights in game play; by pressing the corresponding key the player aims down the actual sights on the gun for increased accuracy. In addition to weapons carried by the player, mounted machine guns and other fixed weapon emplacements are controllable by the player.</Overview>

    <Overview>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (stylized as Call of Duty: MW3) is a 2011 first-person shooter video game, developed by Infinity Ward and Sledgehammer Games (Treyarch for the Wii version), with development assistance from Raven Software, and published by Activision.

    <Name>Call of Duty: World at War</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2008-11-11T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>With the World at War, Infinity Ward's veteran military first-person shooter series heeds a call to return to its WWII roots. Built on the Call of Duty 4 game engine, World at War aims to bring Modern Warfare's state-of-the-art graphics, interactive battlefield environments, unflinching "M"-rated presentation, and sophisticated online multiplayer options back to the World War II setting in which the series earned its stripes.

As (at least) the fourth original console and home computer Call of Duty title set during World War II, World at War offers an expanded selection of era-authentic infantry and vehicle weapons, as well as the tactics that go with them, such as using flamethrowers to burn away camouflaging cover and expose hidden enemies. For the first time in the series, co-operative multiplayer gaming is strongly supported, with team-up options for two players to play through the main campaign in split-screen mode, or for as many as four to play together online.

Call of Duty: World at War is set in the Pacific Theater and in Europe, near the end of the war. In the single-player campaigns, players take the role of a United States Marine or a Russian infantry soldier, and face an onslaught of deadly new techniques, including brutal guerrilla warfare and kamikaze attacks. In online multiplayer games, an increased emphasis on squad tactics in chaotic, bombed-out environments makes coordinated teamwork the deadliest weapon of all.</Overview>

    <Name>Call of Juarez: Cartel</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-07-19T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>When a Mexican drug cartel bombs a U.S. law enforcement agency, the U.S. government puts together a special task force to bring them down. Play as Ben McCall, a brutal LAPD cop and descendent of Ray McCall, or Eddie Guerra, a DEA agent with a chronic-gambling habit, or gang-affiliated street kid turned FBI agent, Kim Evans. Each character has their own unique story. As you fight to dismantle the Cartel and unfurl the mystery of the bombing, you'll embark on an epic, bloody road trip from the streets of Los Angeles to Ciudad Juarez. Experience the lawlessness of today's Wild West as you hunt down the Cartel in a world where the ends justify the means.

Part of the hit action franchise, Call of Juarez: The Cartel is set in present day and brings the best elements of the Wild West to a new and modern setting. As a first person shooter with an immersive and mature story, players can expect to embark on a journey like no other -- one that will take them from the heart of modern day Los Angeles, California to Juarez, Mexico.</Overview>

    <Name>Captain America: Super Soldier</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-06-19T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Players will become Captain America as he faces the Red Skull and his army in an epic third- person action adventure set in the darkest days of World War II.

Wielding Captain America's legendary shield, gamers will engage in free-flowing combat and acrobatic platforming to infiltrate Hydra's mysterious castle and battle the infamous Iron Cross, the forces of Hydra, and a host of nefarious enemies serving the Red Skull. As the First Avenger himself, players must defeat the evil scientist Arnim Zola and his wartime experiments, combining powerful melee combos and shield attacks to devastating effect.

Captain America: Super Soldier combines a highly athletic combat system with fluid platforming and a highly tuned suite of shield attacks, as Cap explores a massive castle turned military installation. His shield can be employed in numerous ways: taking out multiple enemies at once, deflecting incoming fire back at enemies, solving puzzles, and scaling walls. Players will be able to launch shield-first into the fray with the superior force of the world's first Super-Soldier at their fingertips—and they'll need every bit of that strength to overcome a castle that’s both an acrobatic playground for the Captain’s physical prowess and a house of mystery with enemies and danger at every turn.</Overview>

    <Overview>During the game, the player visits five islands, one of them the same island that Sonny will one day wash up on. It reuses some of the locations and characters from So Blonde: Back to the Island but it is not necessary to have played any of those games to understand the story. Travelling on the islands is instant through clicking on locations on an interactive map, between the islands by clicking on the ship in the docks. Progress is made by talking to people, solving puzzles and playing mini-games. The latter are entirely optional. The Nintendo DS version has no voice-overs but is otherwise identical to the other versions.</Overview>

    <Overview>Cars: Race-O-Rama is a racing game set in the Disney/Pixar Cars universe. It is the third entry in a series of THQ licensed games that include Cars and Cars: Mater-National Championship . The game includes a single-player story mode and an arcade mode. In story mode, you progress through a series of races and mini-games with a series of cutscenes. In arcade mode, you can replay story mode events and compete in 2-player split-screen races. The plot of Cars: Race-O-Rama centers around Lightning McQueen as he trains students of the Doc Hudson Racing Academy to compete in the Race-O-Rama Circuit. Soon, Lightning discovers that his arch-enemy, Chick Hicks, is training a rival group of racers who don't race by the rules. Lightning must compete against these rival racers in an effort to win the Race-O-Rama trophy. Story mode uses an open-world format, where you can explore the world and play different events by driving to marked waypoints. There are 7 different main explorable areas including Radiator Springs Stadium, Ornament Valley, Tailfin Pass, Radiator Springs, Santa Carburera, Autovia, and Motoropolis. There are also 3 mini-games based on the Disney/Pixar animated short series "Cars Toons" that center around the character Mater. These include "Mater the Greater", "El Materdor", and "Tokyo Mater". While racing, there is a boost meter that slowly fills over time. Using the boost will give you a quick speed increase. There is also a new drifting mechanic that allows you to take tighter turns and fill the boost meter more rapidly. You can also jump in most races to avoid obstacles and other racers.</Overview>

    <Name>Cartoon Network: Punch Time Explosion XL</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-11-15T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Mysterious forces are at work when worlds collide and the casts of eleven of the biggest Cartoon Network shows battle one another in this all-star brawler! Play as 18 of your favorite Cartoon Network characters based on your favorite show, and look out for cameos from an additional 19 characters who jump in and assist in combat!

Cartoon Network: Punch Time Explosion is a mascot brawler fighting game bringing together several characters from the Cartoon Network Multiverse in one epic battle that plays very similarly to the Super Smash Bros. series. Up to four players (human or CPU controlled) control a character and fight on a multi-tiered 2D stage. Players may use various items that appear randomly to get the fighting edge over their opponent. Additionally, the stage may use set elements in order to take out other players. For example, in the Dexter's Lab Stage players can pull 2 different levers, one setting off a conveyor belt, and the other firing a deadly laser.

When players strike one another, glowing cubes will fall out of them. If players collect enough of these cubes, they will fill up their special meter that, when full, unleashes a powerful "Punch Time Explosion" (the equivalent of a Final Smash in Super Smash Bros. Brawl) attack against their opponents. For example, Ben turns into one of his aliens and launches missiles all over the stage.

In the XL version, fighting characters can team up with certain assist characters (the equivalents of Assist Trophies) and do Synergy attacks. For example, Madame Foster brings a plate of cookies to the arena, Chowder eats them, turning fat, and Madame Foster rolls him around the stage.

Each character has their own special move set that uses different elements from their respective shows. Each has an up, down, and side attack. Most characters have a projectile attack. Captain K'nuckles is the only character who has a disabling attack</Overview>

    <Name>Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2007-07-19T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>From the days of the PS one, this downloadable game allows you to play one of the greatest entries in the Castlevania franchise on your PSP handheld system or PS3 home console.
While its retro 2D graphics may have off-put some PlayStation gamers at first, anyone owning a 16-bit system can easily appreciate the greatness of Konami's Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Konami took the side-scrolling idea to its fullest in this title. The game's enormous maps, huge range of weapons, constant enemies, and excellent balance all still puts this squarely on the all-time list, no questions asked. Add to that a memorable soundtrack and you have a gothic masterpiece that will serve as a benchmark for many future 2D action titles.</Overview>

    <Overview>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs is based on the 2009 computer-animated film of the same name. The player is cast as Flint Lockwood, an aspiring inventor who tries to solve the hunger problem in his town by creating a machine that turns water into food. Soon, the machine is out of control, and it literally is raining food on Flint's town. It's up to him to stop the machine and get rid of the abundance of food. To make matters worse however, the machine is now protected by mutated food.

The player has to fight and puzzle their way through twenty levels, using Flint's self created gadgets such as a hair dryer converted into a heat gun, which can be used to melt obstacles composed of ice cream, or a mechanical boxing glove to punch food. Each level features thirty specific destroyable food items. Destroying all of them unlocks a piece of a blueprint for a special item.</Overview>

    <Name>Colin McRae: DiRT 2</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2008-09-11T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Colin McRae: DiRT 2 is rich with detail on and off the track. Everything from the realistic vehicle damage to the way your co-drivers and rivals address you by your real name (providing you forename is relatively common) immerses you in the experience further.

The graphics are crisp and polished, with the fully licensed vehicles in particular boasting impressive attention detail and eye-popping reflections at the start of each race and, invariably, a thick coating of mud by the end. Environments feature varied backdrops and road surfaces, with landmarks giving a strong sense of identity to each real world location, be it the London Circuit's Battersea Power Station or the Rocky Mountains in Utah.

Topping off the glossy presentation is the soundtrack, which leans heavily towards indie and alternative rock, and features bands old and new, such as White Lies and The Stone Roses. During races, you'll be listening to the roar of engines and context-sensitive chat between your rivals.</Overview>

The real coaches feature was dropped from this game, possibly because the coaches chose not to renew their contracts and all of the coaches are unnamed.

The announcers/commentators featured in the game were Verne Lundquist and Bill Raftery. The College Hoops series was put on hiatus in 2008 as 2K Sports declined to seek the college license for a 2K9 release. EA Sports got the contract before 2K did, so EA will continue to make college basketball games. EA discontinued their college basketball game series in 2010. It is currently unknown if 2K Sports will continue to make their College Hoops 2K series.</Overview>

Graves doesn't really like Lang but they are now both agents of the CIA's Special Activities Division and their mission is to prevent a third-world dictatorship from gaining nuclear weapons.

This mission takes the team across three continents and through hordes of bad guys. To deal with them, both Lang and Graves have access to several types of weapons from pistols over snipers to machine guns, rocket launchers and several different kinds of grenades. But they also earn upgrades for these weapons after successfully finishing a mission. The first upgrade to Graves's 7.62m Sniper Rifle for example allows the player to fire a bullet around the corner or over low cover.</Overview>

    <Overview>Damnation is a third-person shooter set in a steampunk-universe with the player taking over the control of Rourke, fighting through hordes and hordes of enemies as well as jumping from roof to roof and other climbing exercises in order to accomplish his objectives like freeing a prisoner or shutting down a factory. On his side the Indian healer Yakecan and the cowboy Ramon Sepherius Zagato. Of course the enemies don't just drop dead by the sight of Rourke and his friends. Instead everyone can carry around three weapons. Two big ones like a shotgun, grenade launcher or sniper rifle and one pistol which also includes gear like the railroad-spike-gun. In addition the players have access to trip-mines that can either be thrown or planted but always have to be triggered manually. Since the levels are huge and traveling on foot sometimes is either not feasible or possible, steampunk bikes stand ready for the players to be used in two different designs. The small version carries two persons with one being the driver and the second one standing on the back shooting everything in sight. The second version allows for two gunners on the back.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2010-11-16T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Dance Dance Revolution (ダンスダンスレボリューション Dansu Dansu Reboryūshon?), abbreviated DDR and also known as Dancing Stage in earlier games in Europe and Australasia, and some other games in Japan, is a music video game series produced by Konami. Introduced in Japan in 1998 as part of the Bemani series, and released in North America and Europe in 1999, Dance Dance Revolution is the pioneering series of the rhythm and dance genre in video games. Players stand on a "dance platform" or stage and hit colored arrows laid out in a cross with their feet to musical and visual cues. Players are judged by how well they time their dance to the patterns presented to them and are allowed to choose more music to play to if they receive a passing score.

Dance Dance Revolution has been given much critical acclaim for its originality and stamina in the video game market. There have been dozens of arcade-based releases across several countries and hundreds of home video game console releases, promoting a music library of original songs produced by Konami's in-house artists and an eclectic set of licensed music from many different genres. The DDR series has inspired similar games such as Pump It Up by Andamiro and In the Groove by Roxor.</Overview>

Anor Londo sent Knight Artorias to slay Manus, but he was unable to withstand the dark onslaught due to his lack of Humanity and became possessed himself, only able to save his wolf companion, Sif.</Overview>

    <Overview>The player takes on the role of William from a 3rd-person-view. On the ground, the game plays much like any other 3rd-person-shooter with William being able to carry two different guns at each time and having grenades at his disposal. Each enemy the player kills will drop tech points which can be used to upgrade each weapon three times to make it more powerful. But storming into a group of enemies won't help Will to survive long even with that kind of fire-power. Instead the game uses a cover-system that allows the player to blind-fire and regenerate his health automatically.</Overview>

    <Name>DC Universe Online</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-01-11T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>DC Universe Online is a massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) set in the DC Universe. Sony Online Entertainment's stated goal is to make a different kind of MMORPG, with The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction cited as one of the main inspirations for gameplay. SOE is working to make DC Universe Online more interactive than standard MMORPGs, while trying to keep their key elements, which include a leveling system, raid instances, endgame progression and inventories. The world is mainly shared, public space instead of heroes or villains owning territory. The public space features dynamically-generated content designed for both hero and villain player characters (uniquely created by the player, who cannot choose DCU stalwarts).

Players will choose a mentor for their character (Superman, Batman, or Wonder Woman for heroes and Lex Luthor, Joker, or Circe for villains). Their starting location, principal quest rewards and mob loot will be influenced by that decision. The starting zones are either Metropolis or Gotham City, for both heroes and villains. Heroes can also go to the Justice League Watchtower, while villains can enter the Secret Society of Super Villains headquarters at the Hall of Doom. Other safe-houses in the Gotham and Metropolis zones can be reached by teleporters from the two faction headquarters or from the two cities. For the heroes, it's various police stations. For the villains, it's various nightclubs owned by the villains.

Each character is given a communicator appropriate to their faction, via which they receive urgent communications from their mentor and his/her colleagues and subordinates; heroes will frequently receive status updates from Oracle, while villains will receive data from Calculator. In addition to assignments from their mentor, player characters may also receive requests for help from other mentors of the same faction. Player characters may also accept missions from non-player characters (NPCs) in the street, usually minor characters from their faction. There are also opportunities for quick street encounters appropriate to the character's faction: for example, a hero character may encounter a thug robbing an armored truck, trying to break into an office building, or in the process of mugging a citizen; while a villain character may be presented with opportunities to assist NPC thugs with an armored truck robbery, or assault a citizen using an ATM. All NPC interactions are fully animated and voice-acted. Player characters will earn threat ratings that will cause NPC heroes and villains to interact accordingly with the character.

The shared worldspace offers primarily solo and team player versus environment (PvE) gaming opportunities in the form of open air missions and instances, although player versus player (PvP) combat is also possible in this worldspace. Other PvP (and to a smaller extent, PvE) gaming is available in various types of queued instanced encounters: "Legends", small scale PvP combats in which players take on the identities of iconic characters (continued success in Legends combat unlocks additional iconic characters); "Arena", small scale PvP combat in which players fight as their own characters; "Alerts", cooperative team missions; and "Raids", Cooperative PvE missions that are larger than Alerts. Success in PvE missions is rewarded with in-game money, costume pieces, equipment and consumables, while PVP combat is rewarded with unlocks of special equipment sets.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2012-09-25T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Dead or Alive 5 marries its signature fighting style with MMA fighting techniques to deliver a major kick for players new and old. Visually striking scenes from around the world blended with a hard-hitting cast puts players in the roles of the cast of Dead or Alive fighters once again. In DoA 5, stages act not only as visual backdrops to accompany a fight but instead play to a fighter’s strengths. As a fight progresses, the backdrop will change and interact with players. Skilled fighters will be able to utilize these dynamic stages to execute hard hitting blows, pitting their opponents against new obstacles creating a unique experience that will leave you breathless.

With each battle executing a new level of involvedness, the fighters themselves have become more complex in their design. In Dead or Alive 5 players will be able to feel more involved in the action as they see their fighters sweat as they exert more energy. Players can also kick up the competition in online multiplayer modes where fighters must learn to utilize their strength and weaknesses to K.O. challengers.</Overview>

    <Name>Dead Rising 2: Off The Record</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-10-11T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>he entire game is a "What If?" scenario where Frank West covered the Fortune City outbreak, instead of Chuck Greene. As such, the game isn't considered canon within the Dead Rising continuity. It also changes the plot of Dead Rising 2 significantly in regards to the different characters and their motives.

After surviving the zombie outbreak that occurred in Willamette (though now infected with the zombie virus), freelance photojournalist Frank West quickly became a celebrity for exposing the truth behind the outbreak. However, his fame soon vanished due to frequent scandals and controversies. In hopes to regain a place in the spotlight, he accepts an offer from Tyrone "TK" King to appear as a special guest on the controversial pay-per-view zombie-killing show Terror is Reality, taking place in Fortune City, Nevada.

At the beginning of the event, Frank, wearing a wrestling outfit, is lifted via platform into a wrestling ring and made to kill zombies. After the event is finished, a humiliated Frank takes his winnings and leaves. As he is leaving, he overhears TK talking with someone and goes to investigate. With his camera, Frank manages to take some pictures of TK handing money and a strange item to a young man, though a few of TK's thugs attack him when he tries to escape. Frank then calls the elevator to leave, but a loud tremor knocks him out.

When Frank wakes up, he finds that the zombies have gotten loose and are now infesting Fortune City. Frank fights through the undead hordes to the emergency shelter. Security chief Raymond Sullivan initially refuses Frank due to his infection, but Frank bluffs his way in with an empty box of the anti-zombification drug Zombrex. He then meets Stacey Forsythe, who leads her branch of the protest group CURE (Citizens for Undead Rights and Equality) and had been in Fortune City to protest Terror is Reality's zombie-exploitation when the outbreak began. After helping Frank find a dose of Zombrex, Stacey monitors Fortune City from the Safe House and informs him of any new developments or signs of survivors. In three days, the military will arrive to rescue them all.

A news report appears on the Safe House television, and reporter Rebecca Chang runs footage of TK's accomplice placing a bomb on the zombie holding pens. Stacey recognizes him as Brandon, a member of CURE, and her group is blamed for starting the outbreak. Frank goes out to meet Rebecca and the two of them search a security room in the Arena, which has been sabotaged and destroyed. Back in the Safe House, Stacey spots Brandon hiding in a bathroom. He has gone insane, and Frank is forced to fight him to the death.

Frank confronts Stacey about how Brandon was part of CURE and how he started the outbreak. Stacey responds that he was new and TK must have planted him in the group. They continue to argue until Frank notices people moving equipment in the underground on a security camera. Moving through the underground tunnels and fighting off guards, Frank confronts TK. The gameshow host admits that he is indeed behind the outbreak before escaping. TK's men then begin robbing Fortune City's casinos, though Frank stops the attempted heist.

Rebecca invites Frank to come with her and meet her source. Frank arrives, but finds nothing except a transceiver. TK talks to Frank on the other line, demanding that he bring $1,000,000 to the Shoal Nightclub or Rebecca dies. Frank arrives with the money and is confronted by her "source" Amber and Crystal, TK's twin girlfriends and bodyguards. He manages to kill one of them, and the other woman commits suicide out of grief. Rebecca and Frank chase TK to the roof of the hotel, where he is preparing to escape Fortune City on helicopter. Frank foils the escape and captures TK, who is held prisoner at the Safe House.

By this time, the military has arrived in Fortune City to begin the cleanup and rescue. At first, the soldiers have little trouble with the zombies. However, a strange green gas begins rising from the vents in the ground. This causes some of the zombies to mutate, becoming faster, stronger, and seemingly unkillable. No match for the "gas zombies", the military team is nearly wiped out. The sergeant in charge of the team escapes the zombies, and Rebecca follows. Frank heads to the underground, and finds the sergeant has gone completely insane and is holding Rebecca hostage.

After defeating the sergeant, Frank gets Rebecca back to the Safe House. TK refuses to say anything about the gas. When asked why he framed CURE, he says that Brandon was just the name "they" gave him. The Safe House doors are suddenly breached, allowing zombies to flood inside. Frank manages to hotwire the inner doors to close, but he realizes that the breach wasn't an accident, Nearby, TK tries to escape but is knocked over by a zombie and bitten. Enjoying the irony but needing him alive for his story, Frank contemplates on whether he should give TK a dose of Zombrex. He ultimately does so despite TK's ungrateful insults.

The television news reports that since no survivors were found in Fortune City, the military will commence a firebombing to wipe out all the zombies. Realizing that TK could not plant such false news, Frank heads to the underground tunnels to find the source of the gas. He finds a secret base of scientists and soldiers harvesting zombies for Queens, the bee-like parasites responsible for the zombie virus, and grabs a laptop containing classified information from the pharmaceutical corporation Phenotrans, which also produces Zombrex. After studying the information, Rebecca concludes that Phenotrans started the outbreak and created the gas zombies to both produce and drive up demand for Zombrex. She also attempts to call her news station to send helicopters for the survivors.

Rebecca is suddenly shot and Frank turns to face her shooter... Stacey. Sullivan stops her from killing Frank, but he is shot dead and Stacey escapes. Frank chases her into Fortune Park, where Phenotrans soldiers are continuing to harvest Queens from the zombies and storing them in giant machines. After destroying the harvesters, Frank goes to Uranus Zone to confront Stacey, who is actually a Phenotrans agent codenamed "Agent S". Stacey boasts that Phenotrans didn't start the outbreak for money, but to save lives. She explains that they need Queens to make Zombrex and therefore need to make more zombies to produce them. Stacey calls it "a necessary sacrifice for our country", but TK's actions (getting CURE on television and robbing the city) were carried out without her permission. She then turns on a giant robot and attempts to kill Frank, but he is able to destroy it and Stacey is killed when the robot collapses on her. Frank then uses her phone to call Rebecca's news station and demand helicopters for the survivors.

The station sends a convoy of news helicopters to evacuate the Safe House, and Frank helps the survivors board. Before the last helicopter leaves, Frank leaves to get TK, but finds that he has vanished from the Safe House along with Rebecca (who is still alive but badly wounded). TK calls Frank on his transceiver and tells him to prepare for "Overtime". Frank is made to travel through Fortune City and gather various items for TK. When he arrives at the Arena to deliver the items, TK knocks Frank out with a taser. Frank wakes up and finds himself in the zombie wrestling ring again, and he fights them off as TK taunts him from the rafters. Rebecca manages to crawl to a switch and lower a winch for Frank to climb, where he confronts TK and eventually throws the evil host down to the ground below. Frank takes Rebecca and carries her out of the Arena, and a zombie jumps out for one final scare.</Overview>

The EA press release outlined the basic plot of Ignition, revealing that the game "takes place on the Sprawl [the setting of Dead Space 2] and challenges players to survive the initial Necromorph outbreak", which then sets up the plot of Dead Space 2.[1] Executive producer Steve Papoutsis suggested that the game, the first of a number of related additions to the series, "will give Dead Space fans a unique perspective on the events leading up to Dead Space 2, and will also introduce the storyline to a brand-new audience of gamers."[1][2] Dead Space Ignition takes place before the events of Dead Space 2.[3]</Overview>

    <Overview>Returning to Grant City, a boom town gone bust that is falling to the worst excesses of crime, greed and corruption; Dead to Rights: Retribution follows vice cop Jack Slate as he fights to expose shadowy figures that will stop at nothing to exert their deadly influence over the crumbling metropolis. Dead to Rights: Retribution will form an original story portraying key events that shape and define Jack Slate's character including how he and Shadow first come together as partners against those who would bring the once great city to its knees. 

Introducing an innovative hybrid combat system, Dead to Rights: Retribution puts the full combat potential of a highly trained, highly agitated law-enforcement officer into players' hands. Use your sidearm to pick off enemies from a distance, take cover and blind-fire with the game’s new ranged combat mechanics, or push the issue by taking human shields, stealing weapons with special disarm moves or dishing out Jack's own brutal brand of justice with deadly takedown moves. Jack is equally lethal in close-quarters combat, offering players branching melee combos, counterattacks and disarms as they take the fight to the criminal element of Grant City. Jack will encounter a variety of ruthless gangs in the filthy slums and menacing alleys of Grant City, each with their own unique abilities and fighting style that will test his resolve to crush their murderous stranglehold.</Overview>

    <Name>Deadly Premonition: The Director's Cut</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2013-04-30T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Deadly Premonition, known as Red Seeds Profile (レッドシーズプロファイル?) in Japan, is an open world, survival horror video game developed by Access Games for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. In 2010, the Xbox 360 version was published by Ignition Entertainment in North America, Marvelous Entertainment in Japan, and Rising Star Games in Europe, while the PlayStation 3 version was simultaneously released only in Japan by Marvelous Entertainment. A director's cut for the PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows was published worldwide by Rising Star Games in 2013. Set in the fictional, rural American town of Greenvale, Washington, Deadly Premonition follows FBI Special Agent Francis York Morgan as he investigates the murder of an eighteen-year-old woman, which is similar to a series of murders across the United States.

Deadly Premonition is a reboot of Access Game's earlier, multi-platform video game Rainy Woods. In production since 2004, Rainy Woods was cancelled soon after its debut at the 2007 convention Tokyo Game Show due to technological issues.

The game is notable for introducing open world, nonlinear gameplay and a comedy horror theme to the survival horror genre. It is also notable for implementing a free-roaming storyline within an open game world where all the characters have their own schedules.

It has become known for its "headline making strangeness" and is considered one of the most critically polarising games of all-time (holding the Guinness World Record for most critically polarizing survival horror game), receiving both extremely negative and extremely positive reviews[1][2] and is seen by some as an example of games as art.[3]</Overview>

    <Name>DeathSpank</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2010-07-13T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>DeathSpank, (also known as DeathSpank: Orphans of Justice), is a comedy action role-playing game created by game designers Ron Gilbert and Clayton Kauzlaric. It follows the titular character DeathSpank in his quest to find an item known as The Artifact.

DeathSpank is an action role-playing game which also features elements from graphic adventure games. Combat gameplay is similar to Diablo. Players can acquire several pieces of armor and weaponry, each with different abilities and attributes. During combat players can chain attacks in combos, which in turn deal more damage with each hit. As more hits are gained on enemies, DeathSpank's Justice Meter will fill. Once full, the player can unleash more powerful attacks for a limited time.

In-game conversations with non-player characters are also a large part of the game. DeathSpank features advanced dialog options, similar to LucasArts' Monkey Island series which play a large part in unfolding the game's story. These conversations may lead to quests for DeathSpank.</Overview>

    <Overview>DeathSpank: Thongs of Virtue is the sequel to DeathSpank. It was also created by Ron Gilbert and follows a similar action role-playing framework to that established by the first game.

The story continues right where DeathSpank concluded, DeathSpank having discovered his Thong of Justice is only one of six legendary Thongs of Virtue. The other Thongs, however, have corrupted their wearers (who include a nun, a popular TV chef and Santa Claus) and DeathSpank must defeat them to stop the evil of the corrupted Thongs once and for all.</Overview>

    <Name>Deus Ex Human Revolution Director's Cut</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2013-10-22T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Deus Ex: Human Revolution is a cyberpunk-themed first-person action role-playing stealth video game developed by Eidos Montreal and published by Square Enix,[3] which also produced the game's CGI sequences. Originally released in August 2011 for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, it is the third game in the Deus Ex series, and a prequel to the original game released in 2000.[4] An OS X version, Deus Ex: Human Revolution Ultimate Edition, was released on April 26, 2012 by Feral Interactive; it includes the original game and The Missing Link downloadable content.[5][6] An improved version of the game for PC and consoles, including a Wii U version, was released on October 22, 2013 as Deus Ex: Human Revolution Director's Cut.[7] Feral Interactive released the OS X version of Director's Cut on April 15, 2014.[8] The Director's Cut includes The Missing Link as part of the main plot. Microsoft added the game to the list of Xbox 360 games compatible with Xbox One on December 17, 2015. [9]

The game is set in 2027, 25 years before the first game and 45 years before the second game, at a time when multinational corporations have grown in power beyond the control of national governments. The game follows Adam Jensen, the newly hired security manager at Sarif Industries, a growing biotechnology firm. After terrorists brutally attack Sarif's Detroit-based headquarters, the mortally wounded Jensen is forced to undergo radical life-saving surgeries that replace large areas of his body with advanced prostheses and internal organ systems. Returning to work, he becomes embroiled in the global politics of the human enhancement movement in the search for those responsible for the attack. Central themes to the game are the rise of corporations in globalization, espionage, human survival, poverty, and the ethics of advancing humans with artificial replacements for body parts.

Human Revolution received critical acclaim upon its release, with many reviewers praising the open-ended nature of the game and the weight of social interaction on the outcome of events.[10] A sequel, Deus Ex: Mankind Divided, was revealed in April 2015, which will be available on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.[11]</Overview>

    <Name>Deus Ex: Human Revolution</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-08-23T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>In a near future dominated by chaos, conspiracies and biomechanical augmentations, society is divided by various organizations fighting for supremacy, and large corporations extending their power beyond those of governments. An ideological war is growing between people who accept the biotechnological progress and people who fight it. A human revolution is coming.

Adam Jensen is a thirty-four-year-old ex-SWAT member from Detroit, enrolled by a powerful biotechnology company named Sarif Industries. His job is to ensure the scientists' private security and safeguard the secrets of the company's projects. The first day after his hiring, Adam Jensen is about to attend a meeting with David Sarif, the founder and CEO of Sarif Industries, when suddenly a red alert is issued in the company laboratories. A troop of mercenaries, apparently working for Belltower Associates, breaks in and kills several scientists. After having neutralized some of the mercenaries, Adam is severely injured by one of them. He has no choice but to be enhanced with biomechanical augmentations to save his life. His goal is now to discover what were the motivations of the attackers, and unravel a greater conspiracy behind their actions.

Deus Ex: Human Revolution is the third game in the Deus Ex series. The events of the game take place in the year 2027, twenty-five years before those described in the first game. Like the first installment, the game is a hybrid of 3D shooter with a stealth angle and role-playing. All styles of play can be adopted to succeed in the missions, from a totally furtive mode (some bonuses are granted in case the player character hasn't been detected during the whole mission), to the most brutal one. The player's decisions may have an impact on the storyline.

The game offers a vast array of weapons and biomechanical augmentations (hacking, social, stealth, sight, armor or combat skill enhancements, etc.). Various amounts of experience points are awarded for completing main or secondary quests, avoiding or eliminating enemies, hacking, reading electronic books and discovering secret passages. After having accumulated a certain quantity of experience points, the player is awarded a "praxis kit", which can be manually used to learn or improve an augmentation. These kits can also be found during exploration or purchased in clinics.

Role-playing elements include, besides augmentations and general character-building, exploration of non-hostile areas and dialogue with non-playable characters. During certain crucial moments the player will have to participate in a "conversation battle" with a key character, selecting the correct psychological approach and influencing subsequent plot events.

A few modifications have been made to the shooting gameplay, emphasizing its tactical aspect. Third-person cover system is integrated into otherwise fully first-person gameplay. Enemies often appear in groups led by a commander; taking out the latter may demoralize enemies, making them easier targets. Though the game still contains health-restoring items, the protagonist's health regenerates itself over time.</Overview>

    <Name>Diablo III</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2013-09-03T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The game takes place in Sanctuary, the dark fantasy world of the Diablo series. This world was saved twenty years prior by a handful of unnamed heroes in Diablo II, having survived the onslaught brought by the armies of the Burning Hells, who have gone mad from their ordeals. It is up to a new generation of heroes to face the forces of evil threatening the world of Sanctuary.

Players will have the opportunity to explore familiar settings such as Tristram.

The only confirmed NPCs are Deckard Cain, who has appeared in both of the previous games, and his niece, Leah, a new character who accompanies the hero in quests from time to time. The plot will revolve around two surviving Lesser Evils, Azmodan and Belial, and an artifact known as the Black Soulstone. Diablo's world map is composed primarily of two main continents with several small islands in the Northwest region. The world of Sanctuary has been dramatically changed by the destruction of the World Stone in Diablo II: Lord of Destruction.</Overview>

    <Overview>PlayStation 4 players can experience the full adventure of Blizzard’s epic action RPG, Diablo III, as the Diablo III: Ultimate Evil Edition includes the expansion pack Reaper of Souls! Bringing the world of Diablo back to PlayStation gamers, this edition of Diablo III features special four-player co-op features. With the DualShock 4 wireless controller and a custom-designed console interface, players will be outfitted with touch pad functionality and new social features as they engage in pulse-pounding combat with hordes of monsters and acquire items of incredible power.

Diablo III picks up the story twenty years after the events of Diablo II. Mephisto, Diablo, and Baal have been defeated, but the Worldstone, which once shielded the inhabitants of the world of Sanctuary from the forces of both Heaven and Hell, has been destroyed, and evil once again stirs in Tristram. Take on the role of one of six powerful character classes -- Barbarian, Demon Hunter, Monk, Witch Doctor, Wizard, or the all-new Crusader -- and embark on a dark journey through Acts I-V to save the world of Sanctuary from ancient and sinister forces. Players will acquire powerful items, spells, and abilities as they explore new and familiar areas of Sanctuary and battle hordes of demons to safeguard the world from the horrors that have arisen.</Overview>

    <Name>Disgaea 3: Absence of Justice</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2008-08-26T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Disgaea 3 is a tactical RPG; most of the game involves battles on isometric maps upon which the player controls a group of characters. Maps often feature "geo blocks" with statistical effects on the battlefield, that, unlike in previous games, can be stacked or stood upon. Many objects in the environment, including these blocks, and characters themselves, can be lifted, thrown, or destroyed. Certain classes can create boxes or barrels to create stepping stones. Characters can form stacks, allowing them to reach higher areas or perform "tower attacks". When throwing a character to a monster-type ally, they will bounce an extra distance based on the second thrower's direction.
With the newly introduced "magichange" feature, monsters are able to transform into specific weapons in which a partner can use to execute a strong technical attack. To do this they must be assigned to the same club as the ally, and the change is temporary. After two turns the monster disappears from battle.</Overview>

    <Overview>Disney Sing It is a karaoke video game and sequel to High School Musical: Sing It!. It was released on October 28, 2008 across multiple platforms. The game's product description refers to additional downloadable song packs being available. However, as of 28 April 2009, Disney Interactive Support has replied (to a query): "Thank you for contacting us.In some circumstances we need to make some business decisions and drop certain projects that might have been planned or even announced previously. This case falls in one of those situations and currently we don't have any plans on adding any downloadable contents for either Disney Sing It title."[original research?]

The game has received mixed reviews, with both 1UP.com and IGN praising its accessibility towards kids but finding serious fault with the gameplay, with Official Xbox Magazine ultimately calling it a "gateway game" at best.[1][2][3]

    <Name>DJ Hero</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-10-27T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>DJ Hero is a music video game, developed by FreeStyleGames and published by Activision as a rhythm game spin-off of the Guitar Hero franchise. It was released on October 27, 2009 in North America and on October 29, 2009 in Europe. The game is based on turntablism, the act of creating a new musical work from one or more previously recorded songs using record players and sound effect generators, and features 94 remixes of two different songs from a selection of over 100 different songs across numerous genres.

To score points, the player must press buttons to activate accented beats, adjust their crossfade between the two songs, and "scratch" the turntable on the game's custom controller in time to marks that scroll on the screen to score points and perform well for the virtual crowd. The game features both a single player Career mode and cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes. The game also features a mode for selected songs for a DJ player to play alongside another player using a Guitar Hero guitar controller. Many DJ and mix artists have contributed to the game both in the game's development, the creation of mixes, and in lending their images for playable avatars in the game; these including DJ Shadow, Z-Trip, DJ AM, Grandmaster Flash, DJ Jazzy Jeff, and Daft Punk.

DJ Hero was generally well received by game journalists, praising the departure from the Guitar Hero series-style of gameplay, the use of the turntable controller to simulate the motions of a DJ and how the game's difficulty curve helps the player to become skilled on it, and the game's soundtrack; several smaller issues were identified as potential improvements for a possible sequel. However, the game did not perform as strongly as expected by industry analysts, believed to be due to the waning interest in music games during 2009; regardless, DJ Hero is stated by NPD Group to be the highest-grossing new intellectual property of 2009 in North America.</Overview>

    <Overview>Devil May Cry brand new tears -- DmC reinvents Capcom's classic action franchise to explore new frontiers with the series. The "Devil May Cry DNA" of stylish action, rewarding combat and a brash, smart-talking protagonist all remains; however, it has now injected with a dark and brutal gameplay that promises to redefine the franchise.

The Dante of DmC is a young man who has no respect for authority or society in general. Dante knows that he is not human, but also that he is not like the demons that have tormented him throughout his life. Caught between worlds, he feels like an outcast. He is now discovering and coming to terms with what it means to be the child of a demon and an angel. This split personality has a real impact on gameplay with Dante being able to call upon angel and demon abilities at will, transforming his Rebellion sword on the fly to dramatically affect both combat and movement.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2012-05-22T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Doctor Who: The Eternity Clock is a side-scrolling platform game with puzzle elements. It is based on the UK Doctor Who TV series and produced in close collaboration with the BBC, with voice-overs by Matt Smith (The Doctor) and Alex Kingston (River Song). In this game TARDIS is out of control and crashing down to Earth. The doctor is unaware of the crash and must figure out what is going on.

In the 2D environment the gameplay often switches between the two characters and they each have their own tools, such as the doctor's Sonic Screwdriver to solve environment based puzzles, used to open door with a short mini-game. River Song uses her Sonic Blaster to take down enemies and has a hallucinogenic lipstick. There are encounters with Daleks, Cybermen, Silurians, and the Silence.

The game is set in London and spans three time periods: 16th century, present-day and a Dalek-occupied London in the future. Between levels it is possible to interact with the TARDIS. There are different difficulty levels, influencing the available time to complete puzzles, and a cooperative, local multiplayer mode.</Overview>

    <Name>Dragon Age: Origins (Collector's Edition)</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-11-03T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Dragon Age: Origins is a role-playing video game developed by BioWare's Edmonton studio and published by Electronic Arts. It is the first game in the Dragon Age franchise. The game was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on November 3, 2009, and for Mac OS X on December 21, 2009.

Set in the fictional kingdom of Ferelden during a period of civil strife, the game puts the player in the role of a warrior, mage or rogue coming from an elven, human, or dwarven background who must unite the kingdom to fight an impending invasion by demonic forces. BioWare described the game as a spiritual successor to their previous Baldur's Gate and Neverwinter Nights franchises. The game is played from a third-person perspective that can be shifted to top-down perspective. Throughout the game, players encounter various companions, who play major roles in the game's plot and accompany the player throughout the game.

BioWare described Dragon Age: Origins as a "dark heroic fantasy" set in a unique world. Its setting was inspired by The Lord of the Rings and A Song of Ice &amp; Fire, and was described by BioWare as a mix between high fantasy and low fantasy. Development of the game began in 2002, and lasted over six years. BioWare employed more than 144 voice-actors, and hired Inon Zur to compose the game's music.

Origins received critical acclaim upon release, with praise mostly directed at its story, setting, characters, music and combat system. It sold more than 3.2 million copies, and 1 million pieces of downloadable content. Its multiple year-end accolades included Game of the Year and Best Role-playing awards from several gaming publications. BioWare released an expansion pack for the game titled Awakening in March 2010, and two sequels, Dragon Age II and Dragon Age: Inquisition, were released in 2011 and 2014 respectively.

    <Overview>Dragonball Z: Burst Limit is the first game of the Dragonball Z series to hit the PlayStation 3 console. The game features detailed graphics and dramatic, seamless battles, expected from a next generation console. The plans are to have characters and movement reminiscent of the animation, and high-intensity battles.

During each battle, find conditions to create new dramatic scenes. After the battles, watch a unique story unfold each time you play. There is also a stronger element of offense and defense, due to added energy saving and fighting techniques. Features:
Online Feature - Competition grows with the ability to play online in both the co-op and vs. modes.
Unique DBZ Story -During each battle, find conditions to create new scenes and watch a unique story unfold at the end of each game.
Higher Quality Gaming - Experience visuals and movement reminiscent of the anime due to Z3 shading technology and detailed effects.
High Intensity battles - Increased speed of charge and release on the field, free movement around the field, and increased speed and power of attacks.
Energy - Use of special skills will no longer drain energy. The lower your energy, the stronger you get, making for a possible turnaround of the battle.
Fatal Blow - Each character in the game has their own "Fatal Blow". If the player successfully attacks his opponent, this would be a finishing move, but if not, it will put the player in the disadvantageous situation, and he must battle with no "Fatal Blow" for the rest of the battle.</Overview>

    <Name>Dragon Ball: Raging Blast</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-11-10T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Dragon Ball: Raging Blast (ドラゴンボール レイジングブラスト Doragon Bōru Reijingu Burasuto?) is a video game based on the manga and anime franchise Dragon Ball. It was developed by Spike and published by Namco Bandai for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 game consoles throughout North America, while everywhere else it would be published under the Bandai label. It was released in Japan, North America, Europe, and Australia during the second week of November 2009. In Europe, a limited edition pack of the game was also released that included bonus collector material.

The game is a cel-shaded 3D fighter that allows players to play as characters within the Dragon Ball universe, either against the game's AI or another player in one of the various modes of play both on and offline. The game is one of the first games in the Dragon Ball franchise to be published by Namco Bandai in North America, as the company would acquire the gaming license from previous license holder Atari in July of that same year.

The game was met with mixed reviews from gaming critics for its storymode and overall gameplay controls.

The game featured mode called Dragon Battle Collection allows players to play through the original events of the Dragon Ball story, but their actions in battle can change the story in many different ways. Over 100 "Battle Frames" can be selected at any time, regardless of chronological order to which they appear in the series. The story spans from the Saiyan Saga up until the Kid Buu Saga. Battle Frames also include "what-if" scenarios that never occurred in the series. Players can practice and hone their skills in the "Dojo". Players can also partake in the "Super Battle Trial" single-player modes. The online mode features a 16-player "Budokai Tournament", single or team battle VS, and a spectator mode where players can rate the fighters.

New combination moves can now be utilized, allowing two characters to launch special attacks. There are also brand new environmental features such as new advanced interactions with the grounds of the battlefield. Enhanced destructible features such as rocks, mountains, and even the ground below are now destructible. The ground can now split, shatter, or just be obliterated. Players can now also throw enemies into rocks or other environment features, causing the opponent to become trapped, defenseless, and unable to move. The capsule system from previous games also returned, allowing players to customize their characters.</Overview>

    <Name>Dragon Ball: Raging Blast 2</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2010-11-02T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Dragon Ball: Raging Blast 2 (Japanese: ドラゴンボール レイジングブラスト2 Hepburn: Doragon Bōru Reijingu Burasuto Tsū) is a video game based on the manga and anime franchise Dragon Ball and is a follow-up to the 2009 video game Dragon Ball: Raging Blast. It was developed by Spike and published by Namco Bandai under the Bandai label for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 gaming consoles in the beginning of November 2010.

The game is a 3D fighter that allows players to play as characters within the Dragon Ball universe, either against the game's AI or another player in one of the various modes of play both on and offline. The game comes with a new remake of the 1993 OVA Dragon Ball Z Side Story: Plan to Eradicate the Saiyans, now retitled Dragon Ball: Plan to Eradicate the Super Saiyans.

While becoming the second best selling game in Japan for November of its release year, the game would meet with criticism over its gameplay, controls, repetitive AI, and lack of proper story mode.

Like its predecessor, Raging Blast 2 uses 3-D gaming mechanics with the camera alternating from over the shoulder to overhead angles at various moments. The player takes on the role of one of the available characters taking on another character from the franchise using various basic, melée, or signature ki fighting techniques. The combat features a technique called Raging Soul, where players are restricted from ki attacks, but physical attacks become stronger.

Replacing the standard story mode from previous Dragon Ball fighting games is the Galaxy Mode. Here each character is represented by a planet in the game's galaxy. Within these planets are several mission paths. Each mission has various advantages or handicaps that will affect the overall fight. Completing some of these missions will unlock powerups and or other mission paths.[4] Other modes of play are the Battle Zone, where player take on fighters from different zones, on and offline battle modes where players can take on friends or other random players from around the world, and the World Tournament, which players can take part in either Tenkaichi Budokai or Cell games style fighting competition.</Overview>

    <Overview>Dragon Fin Soup is an action role-playing video game created by the independent development studio Grimm Bros. It is the studio's first title and was released on Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 3, and PlayStation Vita.

It is influenced by roguelike games and uses procedural generation for parts of the game. The game has two modes: Story mode follows a story and is more like a typical role-playing game, while Survival mode skips the story and focuses on the surviving within the game and constrains players with permadeath—once the player character dies, the game must be restarted from the beginning.</Overview>

    <Name>Duke Nukem Forever</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-06-14T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Put on your sunglasses and prepare to step into the boots of Duke Nukem, whose legend has reached epic proportions in the years since his last adventure. The alien hordes are back and only Duke can save the world, again. Pig cops, alien shrink rays and enormous alien bosses won't stop our hero from accomplishing his one and only goal: to save the world, save the babes and to be a bad-ass while doing it.

The King of All Shooters is back with over-the-top weapons, massive aliens and unprecedented levels of interactivity. This game puts pedal to the metal and tongue firmly in cheek, among other places. Shoot hoops, lift weights, read adult magazines, draw crude messages on whiteboards or ogle one of the many beautiful women that populate Duke’s life; that is if you can pull yourself away long enough from kicking ass and taking names. Duke Nukem was and will forever be immortalized in gaming history, and this is his legend.</Overview>

    <Overview>Dynasty Warriors: Gundam, originally released in Japan as Gundam Musou (ガンダム無双 Gandamu Musō?), is a video game based on the Gundam anime series. It was developed by Omega Force and published by Bandai Namco Games. Its gameplay is derived from Koei's popular Dynasty Warriors and Samurai Warriors series.[1] The "Official Mode" of the game is based primarily on the Universal Century timeline, with mecha from Mobile Suit Gundam, Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam, and Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ appearing in the game,[2] as well as a few units from Mobile Suit Variations Mobile Suit Gundam 0080: War in the Pocket and Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory appearing as non-playable ally and enemy units. The "Original Mode" of the game also features mecha from the non-UC series Mobile Fighter G Gundam, Mobile Suit Gundam Wing and ∀ Gundam. A newly designed non-SD Musha Gundam designed by Hajime Katoki is also included.[3]

The game was originally released on March 1, 2007 in Japan[4] exclusively for the PlayStation 3 with the name Gundam Musou. A North American version was released on August 28, 2007, for both the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360 under the name Dynasty Warriors: Gundam [5] with English localization by AltJapan Co., Ltd.[6] Dynasty Warriors: Gundam is the second next-gen Gundam game released in North America, following Mobile Suit Gundam: Crossfire. A Japanese Xbox 360 version was released in Japan on October 25, 2007 under the name of Gundam Musou International. Unlike the Japanese PlayStation 3 edition, Gundam Musou International features both Japanese and English voice overs.

An expanded port for PlayStation 2 called Gundam Musou Special was released on February 28, 2008 in Japan, featuring new scenarios and mobile suits.[7]</Overview>

    <Overview>Spacecrafts are transporting enlistees to Neo Venus Construction Inc. (NEVEC) Academy's educational institutions on the planet E.D.N. III. Bren Turner, a candidate from E.D.N. II, is on board among the new recruits when the fleet is suddenly attacked by mysterious Vital Suits. To confront the hostile forces, Instructor Walter Stingray selects Bren to pilot a prototype VS equipped with a next-generation AI, capable of autonomous behavior. As the new "master" of this state-of-the-art machine, Bren designates it with the name "Gingira" and joins Walter to defend the fleet. 

The game features similar gameplay elements to previous Lost Planet games, including the presence of major boss battles, extreme terrain, and Vital Suits. The player controls the protagonist, Bren, from a third-person perspective as he is challenged to navigate through different areas by running, dashing, grappling, zip-lining, and using his jet pack to quickly boost over a short distance. Thermal energy (T-ENG) is now used for charging up special attacks and restoring the life bar, rather than for survival. Players can tap into their T-ENG reserve to release numerous forms of an exothermic (EX-T) blast to deal large amounts of damage to enemies.</Overview>

    <Name>Eat Lead: The Return of Matt Hazard</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-02-26T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Eat Lead: The Return of Matt Hazard is a third-person shooter video game for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 video game consoles. The game was developed by Vicious Cycle Software and published by D3 Publisher.

Eat Lead pits players in the role of the title character, a "legendary" gaming hero who is "returning to glory" in a new video game, some 25 years after his debut game and 6 years after his last game. In reality, the Matt Hazard character is in his first video game, with a history made up by D3 Publisher to chronicle the character's rise and fall in popularity. The Return of Matt Hazard marks Hazard's fictitious "comeback" to the gaming scene. Hazard is voiced by Will Arnett, while Neil Patrick Harris voices his nemesis Wallace "Wally" Wellesley.

The game itself is a parody of action-gaming clichés. The October 2008 debut trailer was done as a Behind the Music spoof called Inside the Game complete with Jim Forbes narration. It chronicles Matt Hazard's successes and hardships, and mirrors the progression of the Duke Nukem series of games, from early 8-bit to modern consoles.[1]

The cast of Eat Lead received a nomination in the 2009 Spike Video Game Awards, under the category for "Best Cast"</Overview>

Echochrome challenges the player to abide by 5 simple laws of perspective, which govern how the player advances through each stage. Offering the most gameplay with the least graphics, Echochrome is likened to playing a M.C. Escher drawing. The player controls an infinite canvas, guiding a mannequin figure by carefully controlling the perspective, tilting and turning the level to create a continual pathway for the mannequin to walk safely through the design. Throughout the encounter, the mannequin will be guided by echos, or shadow guides, used as progress points to advance players along the pathway. There is no set pathway for any level in Echochrome. Players will find different and limitless ways to advance through each stage.</Overview>

    <Overview>El Shaddai: Ascension of the Metatron is an action title with a story based around the flood depicted in the Book of Enoch. You take control of Enoch, an ordinary man who was chosen by God to serve as a clerk in heaven. Enoch must now save humanity by journeying through the world in pursuit of fallen angels. As the story goes, the angels were tasked by God long ago to watch over the world below. Some grew to admire mankind and chose to commit the high crime of descending down to the surface. Angered by this, God considered covering the ground in a great flood. Enoch stepped in and convinced God to hold off on his punishment if he manages to track down the angels. Enoch will be supported on his journey by the angels, who were tasked by God to support him. One angel in particular, Lucifer, appears to have taken a liking to Enoch.</Overview>

    <Overview>In this epic multiplayer-focused game, players can choose to defend humanity as a part of the Global Defense Force (GDF) or destroy it as a merciless Strogg alien invader. Players battle as one of five unique classes in either the conventionally armed GDF army or the futuristic Strogg invasion force, each outfitted with specialist weapons and combat hardware. In this adrenaline pumping fight for survival, warring forces utilize a variety of different vehicles, deployable structures, and defense systems including quad-bikes, tanks, and alien walkers for epic ground assaults; or helicopters and anti-gravity ships to unleash airborne attacks. Throughout each battle, teams establish bases, deploy defense structures, artillery, radar, and advanced forward-command systems into enemy territory while constructing and demolishing obstacles to speed progress and gain a tactical advantage over the opponent. Enemy Territory: Quake Wars features 16-player battles on the console systems, delivering the ultimate team-and objective-based multiplayer experience.</Overview>

    <Name>Enslaved: Odyssey to the West</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2010-10-05T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Enslaved: Odyssey to the West is an action-adventure platform video game developed by Ninja Theory and published by Namco Bandai Games. It was released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 on October 5, October 7 and October 8, 2010 in North America, Australia, Japan and Europe respectively.[1][2] A premium version, featuring all DLC content, was made for Microsoft Windows and Sony Playstation 3 and was later released on October 25, 2013.

The story is a re-imagining of the novel Journey to the West written by Wu Cheng'en. Unlike the original story that was set in a fantastical version of ancient China, the game is set 150 years in a future post-apocalyptic world following a global war, with only remnants of humanity left, along with the still active war machines left over from the conflict. Like the original story however, the plot revolves around someone who forces the help and protection of a warrior, with many characters sharing the same names and roles. The game's story was written by Alex Garland, with voice talent and motion capture from Andy Serkis and Lindsey Shaw.</Overview>

    <Name>Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2012-11-18T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Epic Mickey 2 takes place in a world based on classic and retired Disney characters and attractions. The story begins sometime after the conclusion of the original Epic Mickey, with Oswald and the other Wasteland characters starting to rebuild their world. A series of earthquakes threaten to undo the work, but the Mad Doctor appears and convinces Oswald to join forces and combat the new menace. Ortensia, Oswald's girlfriend, doesn't trust the Doctor, so she and Gus, Oswald's gremlin assistant, bring Mickey Mouse back to Wasteland to help.
The gameplay in Epic Mickey 2 closely resembles that of the original. One of the biggest updates is the addition of Oswald as a supporting character for Mickey; Oswald can either be controlled by the computer or a second player. Oswald uses a remote control in the same basic method as Mickey uses his paintbrush, to attack or befriend enemy characters and to alter the environment as needed to complete tasks. Oswald also has many other abilities, such as flying with his ears, detaching his feet, and so on. There are also some special abilities that can only be used when Mickey and Oswald are working together.</Overview>

    <Overview>F1 2013 is a video game developed by Codemasters based on the 2013 Formula One season. It is the fifth Formula One game developed by the Codemasters studios after the company renewed its license to develop the official games of the series. It uses the EGO Engine.[4]

F1 2013 was released in Europe on 4 October 2013 on PlayStation 3, Microsoft Windows, and Xbox 360. A digital version was released worldwide for Steam Store, as well as on 8 October for the PlayStation Store and 15 October for Xbox Games on Demand. The physical version of the game was delayed in the United States and Canada due to logistic issues specific to SKUs for the two territories. An official release date has not yet been announced for the two territories. This delay did not affect the availability of the digital version in the United States and Canada however, meaning that users could still purchase the game through the Xbox Games Store, PlayStation Store, and via Steam.[5]

    <Overview>Once upon a time you were a famous fairytale character, but you lost your fame! Play one out of 4 different characters in your quest to become famous again. Try to become famous again by rescuing princes or princesses, defeating giants, retrieving magical items and rescue the fairytale world from evil forces. Luckily many different weapons lay around in this fairytale world, which players can use to shoot and carve up enemies... and this is where the fun begins! Foes are sliced and diced in real-time, thanks to Playlogic's inhouse "Dynamic Slicing" technology. Instead of using preset animations, players have the ability to slice up an enemy in any way they like by using the analog stick. Apart from this "cutting" edge technology, the game will also use the tested powers of the Unreal 3 engine.</Overview>

The third game in the Fallout series, Fallout 3 is a singleplayer action role-playing game (RPG) set in a post-apocalyptic Washington DC. Combining the horrific insanity of the Cold War era theory of mutually assured destruction gone terribly wrong, with the kitschy naivety of American 1950s nuclear propaganda, Fallout 3 will satisfy both players familiar with the popular first two games in its series as well as those coming to the franchise for the first time.

The Story: Vault 101 – Jewel of the Wastes
For 200 years, Vault 101 , a fallout shelter, has faithfully served the surviving residents of Washington DC and its environs, now known as the Capital Wasteland.

Giant Insects, Raiders, Slavers, and yes, even Super Mutants are all no match for superior Vault-Tec engineering. Yet one fateful morning, you awake to find that your father has defied the Overseer and left the comfort and security afforded by Vault 101 for reasons unknown. Leaving the only home you've ever known, you emerge from the Vault into the harsh Wasteland sun to search for your father, and the truth.

    <Name>Far Cry 2</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2008-10-21T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Far Cry 2 is an open world first-person shooter developed by Ubisoft Montreal and published by Ubisoft. It was released on October 21, 2008 in North America,[1] October 23, 2008 in Australia,[2] and October 24, 2008 in Europe.[1][3] It was made available on Steam on October 22, 2008.[4] Crytek, the developers of the original game, were not involved in the development of Far Cry 2. It is the second installment of the main Far Cry series; the sequels Far Cry 3 and Far Cry 4 were released in 2012 and 2014, respectively.

Ubisoft has marketed Far Cry 2 as the true sequel to Far Cry, however the sequel has very few noticeable similarities to the original game. Instead, it features completely new characters and setting, as well as a new style of gameplay that allows the player greater freedom to explore different African landscapes such as deserts, jungles, and savannas. The game takes place in a modern-day Central African nation during civil war. The player takes control of a mercenary on a lengthy journey to locate and assassinate "The Jackal", a notorious gun runner. As of January 23, 2009, the game has sold 2.9 million copies.[5]


Far Cry 2 is a sequel to the original Far Cry. The game features an open-ended experience. Players are able to ally with one or multiple factions, and to progress through the game world and missions as they see fit, resulting in a nonlinear style of gameplay commonly referred to as sandbox mode that allows the story to progress at their speed and in the order they choose.[6] Players can use a range of vehicles, including cars, trucks, boats and hang gliders, to travel within the 50 km2 (19 sq mi) gameplay area. The playing styles range from head-on assaults to stealthy infiltrations and assassinations. The game takes place in a sprawling African landscape, with terrain ranging from desert to savannah to jungle.[7]

Various factions and vehicles are featured; enemies include human mercenaries.[8] There is a dynamic weather system that has a day-night cycle and different weather conditions such as storms and strong winds. The time of day also affects the behavior of AI, in terms of enemy alertness and aggressiveness; for example, an enemy might have a slightly heightened awareness at night, but be unable to see the player in hiding, while during the hot part of the day the enemies might be sitting in the shade in groups but easily spot the player from a distance.

The health bar represents the health of the protagonist that is divided into five segments, each of which automatically refills if it is not depleted and the player finds cover for a few seconds. Players carry a limited supply of syrettes which can be used at any time to fully replenish the health bar, and are obtainable from first aid boxes located throughout the game world, specifically at guard posts. When nearing death (only one health bar remaining), the character must perform first aid on himself, for example removing bullets with pliers, or snapping twisted or broken fingers into position.</Overview>

    <Overview>Fat Princess is an action real-time strategy video game for the PlayStation 3, developed by Titan Studios and published by Sony Computer Entertainment. It was released in North America and Europe on July 30, 2009,[1] and in Japan on December 25, 2009.

Fat Princess is a multiplayer game for up to 32 players, with the basic goal of rescuing the Princess and bringing her back to the team's base.

The game contains six character classes (Villager, Worker, Priest, Ranger, Mage, and Warrior) and three downloadable classes (Pirate, Ninja and Giant) each of which contributes to the team's task of capturing the princess in a unique way.

A sequel, titled Fat Princess Adventures, was announced in December 2014 for PlayStation 4. It was released on December 5, 2015.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2007-10-09T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>FIFA 08 (named FIFA Soccer 08 in North America) is the 2007 installment of EA Sports' series of football video games. Developed by EA Canada, it is published by Electronic Arts worldwide under the EA Sports label. It was released on all popular gaming formats in September 2007 in Europe, Australia, and Asia, and in October 2007 in North America. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game feature an improved game engine with superior graphics and different commentators and are dubbed "next-generation" by EA. On all other platforms—including the PC—the game utilizes an older engine. The Nintendo DS version features fewer teams, stadiums, game modes and kits due to the limitations of the machine's storage medium.

Commentary comes from Sky Sports' Martin Tyler and Andy Gray on next generation consoles; however, ITV Sports' Clive Tyldesley partners Gray on current generation consoles, and the PC version of the game. On the DS version of the game, Tyldesley is by himself. It also marks the first time the Nintendo GameCube has been excluded from the FIFA lineup since FIFA 2001 and the first the original Xbox and Game Boy Advance has been excluded from the FIFA lineup since FIFA Football 2002.

The tagline for the game is "Can You FIFA 08?."[2] The theme song is "Sketches (20 Something Life)" by La Rocca, from the album The Truth.</Overview>

    <Name>FIFA Soccer 10</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-10-20T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>FIFA 10 (FIFA Soccer 10 in North America) is the 17th title in Electronic Arts' FIFA series of football video games. Developed by EA Canada, it was published by Electronic Arts worldwide under the EA Sports label. It was released on 2 October 2009 in Europe, 30 September in Australia and 20 October 2009 in North America. It is available for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 2 and Wii.[6] Handheld versions of the game were also released for the iOS, Nintendo DS, PlayStation Portable, and mobile phones.

The demo of FIFA 10 appeared on Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC on 10 September in Europe, on 11 September in Australia, and on 17 September in North America. The playable teams were Chelsea, Barcelona, Juventus, Bayern Munich, Marseille and Chicago Fire. The stadia used in the demo were Wembley Stadium (Xbox 360 version), and FIWC Stadium (PlayStation 3 version). The demo offered friendly matches with half lengths of three real-time minutes. As well as playing a friendly match, the demo allows users to upload created in-game videos and screenshots to EA Football World.[7] The tagline for the game is "How big can football get?", and "Let's FIFA 10". Commentary is available in 12 different languages, with each language boasting around 25,000 phrases. The English version features British commentators Andy Gray and Martin Tyler.

FIFA 10 is the second version of the game to sponsor a football club. Along with football magazine FourFourTwo, FIFA 10 is the co-sponsor of English League One club Swindon Town. The FIFA 10 logo appears on the front of the team's away shirt and on the back of the home shirt.[8][9] It is the first FIFA game to do so since FIFA 07, which sponsored Accrington Stanley for the 2007–08 season.[10]</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2009-02-12T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The pioneers that brought you the award-winning PlayStation Network title flOw are back with another concept that challenges traditional gaming conventions. Flower expands the team's tradition of delivering simple gameplay, accessible controls and a medium to explore emotional chords uncommon in video games. In Flower, the surrounding environment, most often pushed to the background in games, is pulled to the forefront and becomes the primary "character." The player fades from an external and stressful world in the opening of this fresh and genuine game only for PS3, and journeys through beautifully vivid landscapes, changing the his surroundings and exploring nature along the way. 

Playing as the wind, the player guides and grows a swarm of pedals by interacting with other flowers and the surrounding environment. The goals and journey in each level vary, but all involve flight, exploration and interaction with the level. Using simple SIXAXIS wireless controls, the player guides the lead petal and accumulates a swarm of flower petals as he moves at his own pace within the environment, causing the on-screen world to change. Flower's gameplay offers different experiences, pacing and rhythm to all players. Along the way, the environment will pose challenges to the player's progress. 

Both pastoral and at times chaotic, Flower is a visual, audio and interactive escape on PS3.</Overview>

The Heishi clan, seemingly vanquished at the end of Dawn of the Samurai, has returned, its military strength bolstered by the use of unholy magic that allows its legions of soldiers to turn into hulking demons. Yoshitsune and his stalwart friend Benkei must do battle with the newly restored Heishi army; this time, however, they gain two powerful allies in their war—the priestess Shizuka, and the spear wielder, Lord Buson. Like the previous game, it is based on Japanese history.</Overview>

    <Name>Goat Simulator</Name>
    <Overview>Goat Simulator is a third-person perspective action video game developed and published by Coffee Stain Studios. It was released for Microsoft Windows via Steam on 1 April 2014, and ports for Mac OS X and Linux were released on 27 June 2014. Mobile versions for iOS and Android were released on 17 September 2014. Versions for the Xbox 360 and Xbox One were released on 17 April 2015, and for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4 on 11 August 2015; these ports were developed by Double Eleven.

The game has been compared by the developer as akin to skateboarding games, but where the player controls a goat aimed at doing as much damage as possible around an open-world map, without any other larger goals. The game, initially developed as a joke prototype from an internal game jam and shown in an early alpha state in YouTube videos, was met with excitement and attention, prompting the studio to build out the game into a releasable state while still retaining various non-breaking bugs and glitches to maintain the game's entertainment value.

The game received mixed reviews; some reviewers praised the title for providing a humorous sandbox interface to experiment with, while others criticized the game's reliance on social media to popularize what was otherwise a simple and buggy product.</Overview>

    <Overview>God Mode is set in a twisted version of Greek mythology and the afterlife. The player is a descendant of an ancient God whose family has been banished by Hades from Mt. Olympus and turned into a mere mortal. To avoid an afterlife of eternal damnnation, the player must battle through this purgatory known as the Maze of Hades against an army of the underworld.

God Mode combines non-linear gameplay, fast and frantic shooting, hordes of on-screen enemies, and a fully functional online coop mode. Matches rarely ever play out the same, as dozens of in-game modifiers can significantly alter the gameplay on the fly. Characters are fully customizable, both in appearance and equipment, which continually evolve. Gold and experience is constantly accrued and used to unlock new satisfying weaponry and unique powerful abilities, both of which can be further upgraded.</Overview>

    <Overview>A must-have for action/adventure fans on the PlayStation 3 platform, the God of War Collection features both PlayStation 2 single player classics, God of War and God of War II. Remastered in high definition and re-released for play on the PS3 this collection allows both longtime fans of the series and those coming to it new to indulge in the addictive action and puzzle-solving fun of taking on the gods ruling the world of ancient Greek mythology. 

The God of War series, made up of God of War and God of War II, featuring the brutal yet tortured anti-hero Kratos, engrossing storylines based in Greek mythology, over-the-top addictive action and puzzle-solving gameplay and simple controls is often referred to as one of the best, and/or most popular single player action games series ever made for PlayStation 2. The truth in this can be seen in the fact that in an era dominated by more advanced game consoles, fans of the franchise who have held on to their PS2's still revisit these two games from time to time, while gamers who missed their initial releases are tempted to give them a try, even though they have moved on to a PS3. Regardless which side of this you find yourself on the God of War Collection holds something for you.</Overview>

    <Name>Grand Theft Auto IV: The Complete Edition</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2010-10-26T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Grand Theft Auto IV is an open world action-adventure video game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It was released on 29 April 2008 for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles, and on 2 December 2008 on Microsoft Windows. It is the eleventh title in the Grand Theft Auto series, and the first main entry since 2004's Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. Set within the fictional Liberty City (based on New York City), the single-player story follows a war veteran, Niko Bellic and his attempts to escape his past while under pressure from loan sharks and mob bosses. The open world design lets players freely roam Liberty City, consisting of three main islands.

The game is played from a third-person perspective and its world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. Throughout the single-player mode, players play as Niko Bellic. An online multiplayer mode is included with the game, allowing up to 32 players to engage in both co-operative and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single-player setting.[c] Two expansion packs were later released for the game, The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, which both feature new plots that are interconnected with the main Grand Theft Auto IV storyline, and follow new protagonists.

Development began in 2004, soon after the release of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas. As part of their research for the open world, the developers conducted field research around New York throughout development and captured footage for the design team. Development duties were shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide. Following its announcement in May 2006, Grand Theft Auto IV was widely anticipated.[4] Upon release, the game received universal critical acclaim, with praise particularly directed at the game's narrative and open world design. However, the game also generated controversy, with criticism directed at the game's depiction of violence and ability to drive under the influence of alcohol. Grand Theft Auto IV broke industry sales records and became the fastest-selling entertainment product in history at the time, earning US $310 million in its first day and US $500 million in its first week. Considered one of the most significant titles of the seventh generation of video games, and by many critics as one of the greatest video games of all time, it won year-end accolades, including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications. Its successor, Grand Theft Auto V, was released in September 2013.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2013-09-17T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Los Santos: a sprawling sun-soaked metropolis full of self-help gurus, starlets, and fading celebrities, once the envy of the Western world, now struggling to stay afloat in an era of economic uncertainty and cheap reality TV.

Amidst the turmoil, three very different criminals plot their own chances of survival and success: Franklin, a former street gangster, now looking for real opportunities and serious money; Michael, a professional ex-con whose retirement is a lot less rosy than he hoped it would be; and Trevor, a violent maniac driven by the next big score. Running out of options, the crew risks everything in a series of daring and dangerous heists that could set them up for life.

The biggest, most dynamic and most diverse open world ever created, Grand Theft Auto V blends storytelling and gameplay in new ways as players repeatedly jump in and out of the lives of the game's three lead characters, playing all sides of the game's interwoven story.

All the classic hallmarks of the groundbreaking series return, including incredible attention to detail and Grand Theft Auto's darkly humorous take on modern culture, alongside a brand new and ambitious approach to open world multiplayer.</Overview>

    <Overview>Grand Theft Auto: Episodes from Liberty City is a standalone compilation of the episodes for the 2008 video game Grand Theft Auto IV. Created by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games, it contains both The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony on one disc.[2] It was released alongside the DLC release of The Ballad of Gay Tony on 29 October 2009 for the Xbox 360 and released on 13 April 2010 for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation 3, along with the DLC releases of both packs.

Unlike the downloadable versions of the episodes, the compilation does not require a copy of Grand Theft Auto IV to play, nor is an Xbox Live or PlayStation Network account necessary (except for multiplayer). The content is also played straight from the disc, and does not need to be installed on a hard drive to play, like various other disc-based expansions for other Xbox 360 games that have been released in the past. Available exclusively on the Episodes from Liberty City disc are three new in-game radio stations – Vice City FM, RamJam FM and Self-Actualization FM.[4]</Overview>

    <Overview>Drinkbox Studios (developers of Mutant Blobs Attack) bring this non-linear platformer and action game to Sony's Playstation Vita and Playstation Network download service exclusively.  

Guacamelee! is a Metroid-vania style action-platformer set in a magical Mexican inspired world.

The game draws its inspiration from traditional Mexican culture and folklore, and features many interesting and unique characters. Guacamelee builds upon the classic open-world Metroid-vania style of games, by adding a strong melee combat component, a new dimension switching mechanic, and cooperative same-screen multiplayer for the entire story.  The game also blurs the boundaries between combat and platforming by making many of the moves useful and necessary for both of these.

The game features a down on his luck Mexican named Juan Aguacate, who sets out to save the world when El Presidente’s Daughter is kidnapped by an Evil Charro Skeleton. The story takes place in and around a small village in Mexico, and has the player travelling through alternate dimensions: “The World of the Living” and “The World of the Dead” on his quest to rescue the girl he loves.</Overview>

    <Name>Guitar Hero 5</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-09-01T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Guitar Hero 5 (initially referred to as Guitar Hero V) is a music rhythm game and the fifth main entry in the Guitar Hero series. The game was developed by Neversoft and published by Activision, and released internationally in September 2009 for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 2, 3 and Wii consoles. Similar to the preceding title, Guitar Hero World Tour, Guitar Hero 5 is geared towards playing in a four-person band experience, including lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals. The game is available as a standalone title, allowing players to use existing compatible instrument controllers, and as a bundle that provides these controllers. Guitar Hero 5 adds several new features, such as drop-in/drop-out play, bands composed of any combination of available instruments, a Rockfest competitive mode consisting of several various scoring mechanisms, and both song-specific and general Challenges to unlock new avatars, clothing, and other extras in the game. Many of these changes were added to make the game a more social experience, allowing players across a range of skill levels to be able to play cooperatively and competitively against each other both locally and online.

Guitar Hero 5's track list contains 85 songs by 83 separate artists, and like previous Guitar Hero games, several musicians with works in the game have been modeled through motion capture for playable characters in the game, including Johnny Cash, Carlos Santana, Shirley Manson, Matthew Bellamy, and Kurt Cobain. Players can also create their own character and instrument to play with. The game continues to support the user-created music studio introduced in World Tour through GHTunes, and additional downloadable content for the game was also made available. A majority of existing downloadable tracks from World Tour are forward-compatible with Guitar Hero 5, along with selected on-disc tracks from World Tour and Guitar Hero Smash Hits, and songs from the game could also be exported for a fee to play in its sequel, Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, and spin-off game Band Hero.

The game was well received by reviewers, who appreciated the improvements in the accessibility of the game, allowing players to immediately jump in and play without spending excessive time in the game's menus. The game also sold well, however, it sold about less than 50 percent of Guitar Hero: World Tour's sales, specifically selling 1.2 million copies across all platforms. Improvements to both the Career and competitive multiplayer modes were also highlights of the game. However, the game's track list was considered to be too broad, and controversy arose over the ability to use the avatar of Kurt Cobain to perform in any other song within the game.</Overview>

    <Name>Guitar Hero Live</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2015-10-20T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Guitar Hero Live is a music video game developed by FreeStyleGames and published by Activision.As with previous games in the series, the goal is to use a special guitar controller to match fret patterns displayed on a scrolling note pattern on screen in time with the music.

The game serves as a reboot of the Guitar Hero franchise, being the first new entry in the series since Warriors of Rock in 2010 and the seventh installment overall. Activision wanted to bring back Guitar Hero for the next generation of video game consoles but wanted the new game to be innovative. FreeStyleGames was given a free rein to revitalize the series by Activision, which led to the development of a new guitar controller featuring a 6 button, 3-fret layout in contrast to the 5 button controller of previous games. FreeStyleGames also wanted to bring a more immersive experience to the player, and developed the main career mode GH Live to have the note pattern displayed atop full motion video taken from the perspective of a lead guitarist during a concert, with the crowd and other band members dynamically reacting to the player's performance. FreeStyleGames also wanted to forgo the traditional downloadable content model to provide new songs for the game, and created the GHTV mode which encompasses curated playlists in the style of music television channels that are streamed around the clock, allowing them to easily acquire and add new songs. Within GHTV, songs are presented with the note track overlaid atop their music video or from live concert footage. GHTV allows players to pick up and play currently-streamed songs at any time or use money and in-game credits to play any song within the library, forgoing traditional downloadable content. The game was shipped with forty-two songs on disc and 200 songs within the GHTV library; New content has been added to GHTV on a weekly basis, provided through premium shows that earn players unique rewards.</Overview>

    <Name>Guitar Hero: Aerosmith</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2008-06-29T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Guitar Hero: Aerosmith is a music rhythm game developed by Neversoft, published by Activision and distributed by RedOctane. It was released on the PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox 360 consoles, with Budcat Creations solely developing the PlayStation 2 port, Vicarious Visions solely developing the Wii port, and Aspyr Media solely publishing the Microsoft Windows and Mac OS X ports. The game was released on June 26, 2008 in Europe, on June 29, 2008 in North America, August 6, 2008 in Australia and October 9, 2008 in Japan. Guitar Hero: Aerosmith sold as both a bundle with a specially designed guitar controller as well as a game-only package.

The game is considered an expansion in the Guitar Hero series, extending upon the general features of Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock. As with other games in the series, the player uses a guitar-shaped controller to simulate the playing of rock music by playing in-time to scrolling notes on-screen. It is the first game in the series to primarily focus on the work of one rock band, with Aerosmith songs comprising approximately 70% of the soundtrack, while the remaining songs are from bands that have been influenced by or opened for Aerosmith. The single player Career mode allows the player to follow the history of the band through several real-world-inspired venues, interspersed with interviews from the band members about their past. Aerosmith re-recorded four songs for this game, and have participated in a motion capture session to create their in-game appearances. Guitar Hero: Aerosmith is the final installment of the series to only feature guitar and bass as possible instrument choices. The next entry (Guitar Hero World Tour) would introduce other roles to create a full band experience.

While Guitar Hero: Aerosmith maintains the same gameplay as past Guitar Hero games, it has received criticism for being shorter and easier than the previous Guitar Hero titles and difficult to justify its price point; furthermore, with the game's strong focus on one band, reviewers felt that the game's ultimate enjoyment rested on the player's appreciation for the music of Aerosmith.</Overview>

Just as Guitar Hero: Aerosmith was something of a glorified expansion of Guitar Hero III, Guitar Hero: Metallica serves as an extension of Activision's band-focused hit Guitar Hero: World Tour, offering gamers a feel for life in and around one of heavy metal's most popular and influential bands. The game features a total of 49 songs, including 28 original Metallica tracks, such as "Seek and Destroy," "Fade to Black," "Master of Puppets," and "One," and 21 band-selected songs from such acts as Bob Seger, Judas Priest, Queen, and Thin Lizzy. In general, the game's difficulty level was designed to be on par with that of Guitar Hero: Aerosmith, however, the hard-hitting nature of some of Metallica's tracks led to the creation of an extremely difficult "Expert+" mode that can incorporate a second drum pedal.

Though band members James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich, Kirk Hammett, and Robert Trujillo participated in motion-capture sessions to help create lifelike in-game avatars, the story actually finds players in the shoes of a band serving as Metallica's opening act. This narrative mechanic sends gamers to such real-world music venues as the Stone nightclub in San Francisco, the Forum in Los Angeles, the Hammersmith Odeon in London, and the Tushino Airfield in Russia. As always, players must earn high scores and unlock new songs by rhythmically matching onscreen prompts that correspond with musical notes. The music creation aspect of World Tour returns in Guitar Hero: Metallica, with new musical tones based on Hetfield's guitar and a new "Drum Over" mode that lets gamers play improvised drum tracks over any song, while the multiplayer "Battle Mode" comes equipped with new Metallica-themed power-ups such as "Fade to Black," "Ride the Lightning," and "Trapped Under Ice."</Overview>

    <Name>Guitar Hero: Smash Hits</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-06-16T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Guitar Hero Smash Hits (titled Guitar Hero Greatest Hits in Europe and Australia) is a music rhythm game and the fourth expansion game to the Guitar Hero series. The game features 48 songs originally featured in five previous games in the series—Guitar Hero, Guitar Hero II, Guitar Hero Encore: Rocks the 80s, Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock and Guitar Hero: Aerosmith—redesigning the songs to be based on master recordings and to include support for full band play first introduced to the series in Guitar Hero World Tour. The game was developed by Beenox, published by Activision and distributed by RedOctane for release on the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360 systems and was released around the world in the second half of June 2009.

The game reuses many elements from previous titles in the series, including Guitar Hero World Tour and Guitar Hero: Metallica. Beenox designed the game around playing the greatest songs of the series at venues located in the greatest places on Earth, and created venues based on various Wonders of the World for the game. While the game's soundtrack and expansion into a four-player band were well received by reviewers, the game was highly criticized for being a full-cost standalone title instead of being downloadable content for existing games in the series.</Overview>

    <Name>Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2010-09-28T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock features more than 90 tracks that include guitar shredding hits from bands such as Black Sabbath, Megadeth and Slipknot and larger than life anthems from Queen, Muse and KISS.

The sixth full title in the original play-along rock &amp; roll series, Warriors of Rock takes Guitar Hero virtual virtuosos on a journey of metal-inspired fantasy. In the game's Quest mode, players lead eight individual characters to transform into heroic warriors, in a realm of studded black leather and dark gothic undertones. Characters use their individual special abilities to complete rock performance challenges and move the story forward, toward an ultimate battle that will determine the fate of the Demigod of Rock, and indeed, rock &amp; roll itself.

Warriors of Rock hits retail shelves with the largest out-of-the-box playlist yet in the Guitar Hero series, boasting a total of more than 90 tracks from artists including Black Sabbath, Kiss, Megadeth, Anthrax, Def Leppard, and Soundgarden. Hits by artists such as Dire Straits, The Cure, Queen, and The Rolling Stones are also featured. A Quickplay option allows players instant access to the Rock Warrior characters' special powers, outside of the Quest campaign, and players can perform any combination of guitar, bass, drums, and vocals, in Party Play and other familiar Guitar Hero modes.

The initial retail release of the PS3 version of the game is also available in an edition bundled with a hard-rock themed guitar controller, or in a "Complete" edition that includes a microphone and guitar, bass, and drum controllers.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2008-10-26T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Guitar Hero: World Tour is the fourth main game in the series and brings a major change to the concept. Following the release of Rock Band that built on the Guitar Hero concept but added additional instruments, World Tour introduces these as well to allow players to play together simultaneously as a real band. Next to the guitar that was the main peripheral for the previous titles, the bundled edition of the game adds a microphone for the vocal parts and drums for percussion. Just like the previous game, the guitar tracks are split up for the lead and bass. The lyrics and the vocal pitch is shown near the top of the screen, while the bottom part is split up for bass guitar, lead guitar and drums, each with a separate set of notes that need to be hit to correctly play the part.</Overview>

    <Name>Gundam Breaker 2</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2014-12-18T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Gundam Breaker is so appealing to Gundam fans because it really captures the feeling of building YOUR dream Gunpla in-game, earning and using parts from existing real life Gunpla kits! Bandai Namco have even stepped up the 'Build-A-Gundam' features in this sequel by adding 100 different pieces for each slot (head, arms, legs, body, etc.) which will ultimately allow up to 10,000,000,000 (yes, BILLION) kit bashing combinations. The only thing stopping you from putting GPB-04B BEARGGUY's head on every Gundam is your own imagination. What you equip isn't solely aesthetic either and can affect your performance greatly, as well as add abilities. 

Gundam Breaker gameplay and combat is modeled after traditional hack n' slash games and Gundam Breaker 2 adopts many of the same features from the previous title, with improvements to make combat more fluid and fast. Gameplay types are divided into five different mission categories: Normal, Defense, Survival, Team Battle, and Arena Gain. Normal mode has players fight through different stages with a respawn mechanic, while Survival is similar but ends when your HP reaches zero. Defense has players defend a certain point against an onslaught of enemies. Team and Arena allow multiple players to team up and fight together.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2014-12-11T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The game is a third-person fighting game following the Hajime no Ippo story. In the Japanese gameplay trailer the newest character shown is Sawamura Ryuuhei, which indicates the story may cover up to Volume 55, though it also hints at a Mashiba vs. Sawamura match from Volume 72-74. It features a "Best Match Mode" which enables alternate timelines; if Ippo defeats Date Eiji in this mode, he can become the champion sooner and challenge other boxers than he would have in the manga. Other non-canon matches include Miyata vs. Itagaki and Sawamura vs. Sendou. The trailer shows Ippo skipping his match with Ponchai Chuwatana in Best Match Mode, suggesting that certain characters will not appear despite the storyline requiring them.</Overview>

    <Name>Hamilton's Great Adventure</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-08-23T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Hamilton's Great Adventure is a puzzle game for Microsoft Windows, Playstation 3 and Android . The game was the first self-published title from the Swedish developer Fatshark, which was considered a surprising change in the developer's choice of gameplay and genre since it focused more on single-player elements with a relatively low learning curve.[1]

Hamilton's Great Adventure was released on May 31, 2011 via the Steam digital distribution platform, and was later released on August 23, 2011 for Playstation 3. On December 17, 2012, the game was released under the title Hamilton's Adventure TDH for Android.

Gameplay[edit]
Hamilton's Great Adventure is a puzzle adventure platforming game in which the player assumes the role of the explorer Ernest Hamilton and his bird Sasha. The player primarily controls Hamilton, while occasionally switching to his bird Sasha (in co-op, the second player controls Sasha). The game is split up into shorter levels, in which the objective is to collect keys and reach the exit. Sasha is able to reach switches that are off the main path, clearing obstacles for Hamilton. [2]

The game has over 60 levels stretching over numerous locations, such as the Jungles of the Amazon and the Mountains of Himalaya. The enemies that Hamilton encounters during his expeditions include hungry Piranhas, flying Exocets, slow but unstoppable Golems and cunning Agents.</Overview>

    <Overview>Hard Corps: Uprising is a video game developed by Arc System Works. It is a prequel to Contra: Hard Corps as well as the original Contra. Kenji Yamamoto, the producer, has said that the intention is to make the Hard Corps series into a brand new franchise. The player assumes role of Colonel Bahamut, along with other main characters. Konami has added three additional player characters (Sayuri, Harley Daniels, and Leviathan) via downloadable content. The game was released on Xbox Live Arcade in February 16, 2011 and on the PlayStation Network in March 15, 2011.

In 2613, twenty years before the events of original Contra, the world is ruled by an empire known as the Commonwealth, under the reign of Tiberius. Neighboring nations have suffered under the Commonwealth's oppression and resistance forces rise across the land. However, so many resistance fighters have fallen to the overwhelming might of the empire, that their strength is now severely diminished. A group of elite soldiers rise through the ranks of the resistance and band together to execute a desperate plan. The leader of this group is the war hero Bahamut.</Overview>

    <Name>Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-06-30T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Magic-minded gamers have a chance to play through the penultimate Potter picture, in the interactive interpretation of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince. Based on the film and featuring characters modeled on the likenesses of its stars, the game presents missions and side-quests that lead players through the story of the sixth novel in J.K. Rowling's extraordinarily popular book series. In terms of play style, Half-Blood Prince is similar to its immediate predecessor, Order of the Phoenix. Players are free to explore Hogwarts, the sprawling arcane academy, where they will find discovery points, in key locations, that activate quests and challenges which can reveal plot information and move the story forward.

Players can enter into wizard duels and play Quidditch in the game, and as in the book, the powerful effects of both custom-brewed potions and teenage romance can have heavy influence over the way events unfold. Half-Blood Prince features a day-night cycle, allowing players to sneak out after sundown and complete missions that might raise suspicion in the light of day. In addition to duels with students from other Hogwarts houses, players will face off against dangerous opponents such as Death Eaters and Inferi. As Gryffindor's star seeker, players will also compete for the Hogwarts Quidditch Cup. Following the story of the book, mini-games allow players to try their hand at mixing potions, using recipes from the old, annotated textbook of the mysterious Half Blood Prince.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2013-08-27T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Project Diva F Is the fifth game in the Project Diva series. It retains the same basic gameplay with several new changes such as the Star symbol. The Star represents the "Scratch" move where instead of pressing the face buttons players flick the analogue stick.

Chance Time has been modified from previous installments with each successful beat filling a star shaped gauge on the bottom left of the screen. When filled it triggers a final scratch symbol that will change the outcome of the scene if hit. Technical Zones have also been added where players must maintain an uninterrupted combo for bonus points. Additional features like DIVA Room and Edit Mode return with additional features.

The game features graphical improvements over its predecessors though it continues the use of the character models from the PSP games as opposed to the Dreamy Theater models. The game features smoother movements for, improved facial expressions, and real-time lighting computation.</Overview>

    <Overview>Hellboy: The Science of Evil is a video game adapted from the 2004 Hellboy film by Guillermo del Toro, based on the comic book character of the same name. It was released for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and PlayStation Portable on June 24, 2008 in North America, followed by an August 15 release in Europe and August 28 release in Australia.[1]

All versions follow the same story line, however the PSP version of the game differs from the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions. There are 4 playable characters: Hellboy, Abe Sapien, Liz Sherman and Lobster Johnson (voiced by Bruce Campbell). Herman von Klempt (voiced by Jürgen Prochnow), the Nazi head-in-a-jar, who, unusually, is supplied with a full body in the video game, is the game's main villain, along with several of his 'kriegaffen'. The game has online and offline multiplayer co-op for up to 2 players.

The game was created under the creative direction of both the comic book's creator, Mike Mignola, and the film's director, Guillermo del Toro. Ron Perlman, Selma Blair and Doug Jones reprise their roles from the film as Hellboy, Liz Sherman and Abe Sapien respectively, providing full voice-overs.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2012-11-20T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>In the aftermath of Hitman: Blood Money, Diana Burnwood, Agent 47's handler with the International Contract Agency, suddenly goes rogue, carrying out a catastrophic sabotage that includes publicly exposing the Agency. The Agency reforms under Agent Benjamin Travis; Travis assigns 47 to kill Diana and bring Victoria, a teenage girl in her care, to the Agency. Shooting and wounding Diana in her home in Chicago, 47, rather than executing her, comforts the dying Diana, who gives him a letter and asks him to keep Victoria safe from the Agency.[8]

47 hides Victoria at a Catholic orphanage somewhere in Chicago and contacts an International Contracts Agency (ICA) informant named Birdie, who asks him to kill a wealthy gangster nicknamed The King of Chinatown, in order for him to play ball. After eliminating him, 47 meets with Birdie, who briefs him about Blake Dexter, the CEO of Dexter Industries, who may have more information on Victoria. As payment, 47 is forced to give his signature Silverballers to Birdie. 47 learns that Dexter is in the "Terminus" hotel and after evading Dexter's henchmen, eavesdrops on him. 47 learns from Dexter's conversation with his secretary Layla that he plans to kidnap and auction Victoria to the highest bidder. 47 attempts to strangle Sanchez, Dexter's enormous bodyguard, who proceeds to knock 47 unconscious. After Dexter discovers who he is, he almost kills him, but decides as he doesn't want that kind of attention. Just then, a hotel maid comes in and discovers 47, thinking he is dead. Dexter kills her, plants the weapon with 47, douses the room in alcohol, ignites it, and leaves with Layla and Sanchez. Framed by Dexter for the murder, 47 escapes the hotel and evades the police. 47 contacts Birdie, who tells him to go to a local strip club and kill the owner, Dom Osmond, who works as an informant for Blake Dexter, so that he can protect Victoria. 47 kills Osmond and learns from a phone message in his office that Birdie is being hunted by Wade—–a sociopathic mercenary, who is a close friend of Dexter and is under his employ. Despite killing henchmen that were looking for Birdie, Birdie still sells Victoria's location to Wade so that he can save his life. 47 reaches Victoria and learns that the necklace Victoria has keeps her alive. Wade and his henchmen raid the orphanage and massacre most of the nuns. 47 is forced to pick up fuse boxes that are scattered across the orphanage, since the elevator to the basement breaks down. After finding them all, 47 installs the fuse boxes and starts the elevator. Despite 47 's efforts, Victoria is still kidnapped by Wade. 47 manages to shoot Wade, but Victoria is then taken hostage by Lenny, Dexter 's son. 47 interrogates Wade to reveal Victoria 's location—–Hope, South Dakota—–and leaves him to die of his injuries. Meanwhile, Birdie approaches Dexter, offering to broker the ransom of Victoria back to the Agency, but he is rejected. In anger, Birdie secretly provides information about 47 's location to Travis's assistant, Jade, and information about Dexter to 47, hoping to profit off the situation. After arriving in Hope, 47 retrieves his Silverballers after Birdie informs him of their location at a gun store. Later, 47 kills Lenny 's gang and interrogates Lenny himself. The player then drives him to the desert, and the player can either kill him or leave him in the desert. Learning from Lenny that Victoria is at the Dexter Industries HQ, 47 infiltrates the facility and destroys their research data on her while assassinating its scientists, and discovers that Victoria is in fact a genetically engineered clone bred to be a top-class assassin like him; however she can only use the skills of an assassin when she wears her necklace. 47 kills Sanchez in an underground cage fight after learning from him that Victoria was taken back to Hope. Recuperating at a hotel, 47 survives an ICA attack led by The Saints—–elite nuns in leather outfits and kills them.

Infiltrating Hope Courthouse Jail, 47 reaches Victoria but is subdued by the corrupt local sheriff Clive Skurky, who is working with Dexter. The ICA, led by Travis, take over the town in an attempt to get Victoria back and kill 47; but she is nowhere to be found, while 47 escapes the jail and the 'Agency. He then confronts a wounded Skurky in a church, demanding Victoria 's location. Skurky tells 47 she is at Blackwater Park, then dies from his wounds. Travis pays a ransom of ten million dollars for Victoria, but Dexter doesn't keep his side of the bargain and keeps both Victoria and the money. 47 arrives at Dexter 's penthouse and kills Layla after she tries to seduce him (and fails). Dexter, not knowing that Layla has been killed, threatens to destroy the hotel's roof if she doesn't meet him there within five minutes. As Dexter is about to leave the hotel with Victoria and the money by helicopter, 47 mortally wounds him. 47 saves Victoria, while Dexter, with his dying words, apologizes to his Lenny, and asks for his money. Victoria, who is disgusted by Dexter 's words, opens the briefcase containing the ransom and throws the money onto his dying body. 47 and Victoria then leave the hotel. 47 learns from the letter Diana gave to him that Travis created Victoria without the Agency 's knowledge; in the letter, she also requests that 47 kill Travis to protect Victoria. Pursuing him to England, 47 finds the ICA exhuming the Burnwood family graves, believing Diana 's death to have been faked. After killing Jade, and then his personal guards, 47 corners Travis, who asks him if Diana is dead. 47 refuses to answer and kills Travis.[9] During a closing cutscene, 47 watches Diana and Victoria from afar before a message from Diana welcomes him back to the Agency, revealing that the shot 47 fired at her was non-lethal. Victoria also considers disposing of her necklace to prevent her from hurting anyone, with Diana telling her to do what she has to. Another cutscene then shows Birdie offering information on 47 to Cosmo Faulkner, a detective investigating his case.</Overview>

    <Name>Hitman: Contracts</Name>
    <Overview>The game begins with a cutscene showing a wounded Agent 47 wandering through a dark hotel corridor and arriving at his room. Upon entering, he collapses and begins to have flashbacks regarding previous assassinations he committed, beginning with the aftermath of killing Dr. Ort-Meyer at the end of the original game. The missions are primarily focused on replays of previous missions in the original game, except played in reverse. The graphics, maps and artificial intelligence have been improved and modified. Perhaps due to 47's feverish state of mind as he remembers these past missions, it is raining in nearly every level. In the game, 47 visits several locations, including Romania, Kamchatka, the United Kingdom, Rotterdam, Budapest, Hong Kong, and finally Paris.</Overview>

    <Overview>Hohokum is an art video game by British developer Honeyslug in collaboration with artist Richard Hogg and Sony Santa Monica for PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation Vita. The player controls a snakelike creature to explore 17 whimsical worlds with no set objectives. The developers, who began development in 2008, compared the concept to flying a kite and were inspired by free London museums, Portmeiron, and indigenous cultures. It features a soundtrack by Ghostly International artists and was released on August 12, 2014. The game received "mixed or average reviews", according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic.[2] Critics appreciated the game's presentation, including its art and music, but felt that the gameplay turned to drudgery towards its end and that the objectives were too vague.</Overview>

    <Name>Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2008-03-18T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Hot Shots Golf makes its first appearance on PlayStation 3 with online support for multiplayer competition and a new shot system. The framework is otherwise the same as in previous games in the series, which began on the original PlayStation in 1998. Cutesy characters with large heads and whimsical expressions can compete on six new courses filled with onlookers, animals, and other animated surprises. The new venues take place along a coast, on a mountain range, in the woods, and across a desert. The shot system by default forgoes the horizontal power meter in favor of a swing-based approach in which players use visual cues to time their backswings and follow-throughs. Traditionalists can still, however, revert back to the old swing system from the options menu.

Once again a number of customization features are available to personalize each of the game's 15 characters and six caddies. By competing in different events, players can unlock new equipment such as enhanced clubs and balls. Hot Shots Golf: Out of Bounds also includes a robust online component, with the ability to create custom tournaments supporting up to 50 players. Online avatars can be tweaked with 300 visual options, including hairstyles, masks, clothing, and more. Players can also send messages to friends, or visit the PlayStation Store to purchase new courses, clubs, characters, and other features. Key play modes include Versus, Training, Tournament, Stroke, and Match Play. Detailed statistics are tracked throughout each mode and challenge, from best average score and driving distance to average putt length and putting accuracy.</Overview>

    <Name>Hydrophobia Prophecy</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-11-01T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Hydrophobia is a survival-adventure video game developed and published by Dark Energy Digital for Microsoft Windows, the PlayStation 3 and by Microsoft Studios for Xbox Live Arcade. The game was released for Xbox Live Arcade on September 29, 2010,[2] as part of Xbox Live's 'Games Feast' promotion, marking the first of three episodes. The PC version was released on May 9, 2011.[3] The PlayStation 3 version was released on November 1, 2011 in North America and November 2, 2011 in Europe.

The game's engine, HydroEngine, provides realistic fluid dynamics technology for flowing water, allowing it to interact with the surroundings. The levels in the game were designed using InfiniteWorlds; a game creation system which uses bespoke procedural technology to significantly reduce file sizes, decreasing the overall file size of the game.

Hydrophobia was met with a mixed reception, with an aggregate score of 59/100 on Metacritic and 61.43% at GameRankings. Reviews have been polarized, ranging from a 20% approval to 90%. Reviewers generally praised the game's dynamic water system, but felt the game was too short and repetitive. The developers released a title update on December 21, 2010 addressing the complaints from feedback and reviews.</Overview>

    <Name>Hyperdimension Neptunia mk2</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2012-02-28T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Peril in Gamindustri! CPU Candidates, Assemble! Serving as a more of a reboot than a straight sequel, mk2 takes place in an alternate dimension and doesn't continue the story of its predecessor. Rampant piracy has led to the rise of the Arfoire Syndicate, a group of four criminals who hope to revive the Diety of Sin, Arfoire. This time around the player takes control of Nepgear, Neptune's little sister. Having recently been freed from the Gamindustri Graveyard, Nepgear must unite the CPU Candidates, free their older sisters from the Graveyard, and put a stop to the Syndicate's evil ambitions. 

The gameplay has been completely revamped. Battles are no longer random as enemies appear on the map. Battles play out in small, open areas and party members are able to move freely within their range. Movement and actions are dependent on an Action Gauge. Different abilities reduce the gauge by different amounts and a character's turn ends when the gauge is depleted.</Overview>

    <Overview>ibb and obb is a puzzle platform video game developed by Sparpweed Games for PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows. It began as Richard Boeser's graduation project and debuted at IndieCade in 2008.[1]

The green creature, ibb, and the pink creature, obb, travel through a world divided by a thin horizon line; on either side of the barrier, everything is inverted and gravity works in opposite directions.[2] The game is focused on cooperative play and the two characters must work closely together to progress through the game.[3]

The intentionally lowercase names of ibb and obb come from the book The Well of Lost Plots by Jasper Fforde, where two "generics" with these names must earn their capital letters by evolving as characters.[4]</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2013-08-29T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: All Star Battle is a 3D fighting game in which players can fight against each other using characters taken from all eight current story arcs from Hirohiko Araki's JoJo's Bizarre Adventure manga series (and one from a prior work by Araki), fighting in various locations taken from the manga. Like most fighting games, the aim is to defeat your opponent by draining their stamina gauge (HP is used in a certain game mode) with various attacks and special techniques. The player wins a round by draining all of their opponent's stamina, or by possessing more stamina than their opponent when time runs out. Gameplay uses five main buttons; light, medium, and heavy attacks, a dodge button, and a "Style" button. Along with the ability to use various special attacks and techniques with different directional inputs, each character possesses a Battle Style, allowing them to utilize additional moves with the "Style" button. Styles fall into one of six main categories: Ripple, Vampirism, Mode, Stand, Mounted, and Baoh Armed Phenomenon, each utilizing different abilities when the Style button is pressed. For example, Ripple users can use the power of the Ripple to augment the strength of their attacks, whilst Stand users can summon out their Stand, giving them additional move types whilst also making themselves more vulnerable.</Overview>

    <Name>Karaoke Revolution Presents: American Idol Encore</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2008-03-18T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Karaoke Revolution and its many sequels are video games for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Nintendo GameCube, Wii, Xbox, and Xbox 360, developed by Harmonix and Blitz Games and published by Konami in its Bemani line of music games. The Original Concept for Karaoke Revolution was created by Scott Hawkins and Sneaky Rabbit Studios.[1] Technology and concepts from the game were subsequently incorporated into Harmonix's game Rock Band.

The Japanese versions of the game are developed by Konami themselves. The gameplay also differs significantly. Rather than a game per se, it is merely a karaoke system for the PlayStation 2, with no judgments.

The game does not attempt to understand the singer's words, but instead detects their pitch. As such, singers can hum to a song or sing different lyrics without penalty. The game adapts to the player singing in a different octave than the song, to accommodate players whose vocal ranges do not fit the song.

The songs in the game are covers of pop hits frequently sung in karaoke bars. This contrasts with the SingStar series from Sony Computer Entertainment Europe, which features only original artist recordings along with the music videos, where available. However, the 2009 remake of the game (titled Karaoke Revolution, just like the original) features all master tracks.[2]</Overview>

Remixed classic Katamari Damacy tunes, a brand-new storyline, multiple new visual effects and 1080p graphics round out Katamari Forever into the ultimate Katamari experience ever.

A terrible event has occurred causing the stars to disappear from the night sky and the King of All Cosmos to fall into a coma. The Prince must use his finely tuned Katamari rolling skills once more to re-create the absent celestial bodies, save his royal father and restore order to the Cosmos. Thumb tacks, sushi, cats, people, skyscrapers, ocean liners and continents - nothing is safe as the Prince makes his way through the largest variety of stages in a single Katamari game ever. New graphical styles give Katamari Forever a certain "je ne sais quoi" that all new Katamari games possess. A few of the new styles include Wood, which uses warm sepia tones to give stages a wooden feel, while Comic creates thick black outlines on every object while filling them in with deep, rich colors. Make sure to try them all out and find your favorite for a totally new way to experience the world of Katamari.

In addition to all these great new features, Katamari Forever also contains local cooperative and competitive multiplayer modes. Choose your favorite cousin and play together or compete in heated Katamari competition. Who will become the Katamari champion in your house?</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2013-07-25T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>In the year 2054, chaos spreads over the globe as global warming finally exacts its toll on Earth: the ice caps quickly melt, causing a tremendous series of cataclysms and for entire nations to disappear under the sea. The near apocalyptic setting and the quickly depleting resources of the remaining dry lands force nations into constant war, eventually culminating into World War III; all efforts by the United Nations to cease hostilities are thwarted by a seemingly endless supply of technologically advanced weaponry being sold to each side of every conflict. After investigation, the source is tracked back to EVAC Industry co. ltd, an arms dealer who's been reaping tremendously high profits from the situation, at times directly intervening to fuel the hostilities with utter disregard towards human lives; any attempt to negotiate with the board of directors has utterly failed, the earnings having proven high enough for the company to build its own cities, shipyards, defensive emplacements and even a private airport, to the point of assembling its own army of extremely well equipped mercenary troops.

Being unable to enter the fray officially, the UN sets up a strike team of four pilots, each pair given one of two advanced helicopters: the plan is to simulate a rebellion within EVAC forces and bring down the company's headquarters, where research on a series of tremendous warmachines is taking place; for this reason, the planes both bear EVAC insignia and callsigns and are built according to stolen prototype blueprints - by no means, in success or failure, must the operation be traced back to the United Nations. However, for all this secrecy to be effective, even in victories the assault choppers will have to be destroyed... and the pilots killed. However, to compensate for their sacrifice, the UN shall fulfill one of their wishes, no matter what it is. And this, on board a stolen EVAC carrier plane, is how the story begins...</Overview>

    <Name>Kidou Senshi Gundam: Extreme VS. Full Boost</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2014-01-30T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Mobile Suit Gundam: Extreme VS. Full Boost is the sequel to the fan favorite Mobile Suit Gundam: Extreme VS. Like its predecessor, this arcade based Gundam-on-Gundam fighting game blazes through with increased features and epic battles akin to the Gundam Extreme series. As a port of the arcade version, expect additional units exclusive to the PS3. 

Gameplay revolves around strategically choosing asquad and sending them into battle. There are many Gundams to choose from, from vague one shot characters to famous flagship mechas from almost every series. In battle, there is the standard arcade mode faithfully representing its source material as well as an amalgam of extra missions and content. Actual gameplay changes are the introduction of 2 important additions: the Extreme Action where players have the ability to dash-cancel attacks for chaining complex combos and the Extreme Burst, a super mode reminiscent of the original's Awakening mode. During the Extreme Burst, an ultimate attack called the Burst Attack can be used, and each mobile suit has two types of this attack to choose from.</Overview>

    <Name>Killzone Trilogy</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2012-10-23T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Killzone was released for the PlayStation 2 in 2004. The game is set in an era of space colonization where the Helghast Empire has recovered from its defeat in the First Helghan War and launched a blitzkrieg against the outer Interplanetary Strategic Alliance (ISA) colony planet Vekta. Vekta's orbital Strategic Defense (S.D.) platforms failed during the initial assault, allowing the Helghast to land swarms of soldiers onto the surface and making it all the more difficult for the outnumbered ISA forces. Captain Jan Templar, the main protagonist, and his squad are called back to the base for reassignment, and are promptly sent to find the ISA operative Hakha and the key in his possession. During the course of the game, Templar meets other characters who assist him such as Shadow Marshal Luger (a female special operations assassin), a heavy weapons specialist Sergeant Rico Velasquez (a Helghast-hating soldier with an itchy trigger finger), and Colonel Hakha, a half-Helghast, half-Human spy.

Killzone 2 was released for the PlayStation 3 in 2009. Killzone 2 follows the events of Killzone and Killzone: Liberation, and is set entirely on the planet Helghan, the home-world of the Helghast who invaded an Interplanetary Strategic Alliance (ISA) colony. Two years after the Helghast assault on Vekta, the ISA has launched an assault on the enemy's homeworld of Helghan. The ISA goal is to capture the Helghast leader, Scolar Visari and bring the Helghast war machine to a halt. The main protagonists is Sergeant Tomas "Sev" Sevchenko, a battle-hardened veteran of the special forces unit the "Legion" assigned to Alpha team, who go on a mission to take out the Helghast threat. Captain Jan Templar has been promoted to Colonel and is the Fleet Commander of the New Sun, a Cruiser airship set up in the clouds of Helghan over its capital city, Pyrrhus, preparing for a final attack. During the invasion of Helghan, Sev's unit is deployed behind enemy lines to assist the main invasion force. Tasked with securing the enemy capital of Pyrrhus, Helghan's first true city, the team quickly discovers that the Helghast are a more formidable enemy on their home planet. Not only have they adjusted to Helghan's hostile conditions, they have also harnessed the power of the freakish lightning storms that always occur on Helghan which they can now use against the ISA. A cold, barren, unforgiving world, Helghan provides a ready defense with thick, acidic air, dust clouds, and violent surgical lightning storms. Sev discovers his squad is not just fighting enemy forces—their fiercest opponent may be the planet itself.

Killzone 3 was released for the PlayStation 3 in 2011 and is the only game in the series to feature a special edition, support the PlayStation Move, and utilize 3D gaming. It immediately follows the events of Killzone 2. Visari, the leader of the Helghast is gone, but the war is far from over. Helghast forces have mounted a devastating counterattack, prompting the ISA (Interplanetary Strategic Alliance) evacuation of planet Helghan. As new Helghast battalions appear, armed with more powerful weapons, ISA forces find themselves outmanned, outgunned and surrounded. Two new antagonists appear, Jorhan Stahl and Admiral Orlock, who both want to become the new Autarch of Helghan. Sev returns as the protagonist with Rico and Narville. Admiral Orlock eventually becomes the new Autarch due to a circumstantial decision by the Helghan High Council. In a final confrontation between Stahl and Orlock, Stahl murders Orlock, however, the planet Helghan and Stahls ship is nuked by Sev and his team. However, it revealed that a ship crash landed on Helghan and is greeted by two Helghan soldiers.</Overview>

    <Name>Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 ReMIX</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2013-12-31T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5 ReMIX includes...

KINGDOM HEARTS: FINAL MIX
In the original and Final Mix versions of Kingdom Hearts, the command menu had four commands: Attack, Magic, Items, and a fourth context-sensitive slot that varied depending on what the player had targeted, where they were, etc. The command menu has been updated to include "Attack", "Magic", "Items", and "Summons" in the fourth slot, which was originally located as a sub-category beneath the "Magic" menu. The original fourth command has been replaced by the introduction of Reaction Commands from Kingdom Hearts II and are triggered by pressing the Triangle Button. The camera works more similarly to that of Kingdom Hearts II, utilizing the right thumb stick to move the camera and allowing the player to click the R3 button to reset the camera behind Sora, as opposed to the original game which made use of the shoulder triggers L2 and R2 to position the camera. Overall, the gameplay of Kingdom Hearts Final Mix was modified so it would play more similarly to Kingdom Hearts II and Re:Chain of Memories, to create a more consistent play style throughout the series.

KINGDOM HEARTS: RE:CHAIN OF MEMORIES
This version of Chain of Memories was released in Europe and Australia for the first time as part of the collection, as it was previously released in North America in December 2008.

KINGDOM HEARTS: 358/2 DAYS
This game, originally released for the Nintendo DS, does not appear in playable form in this collection, and is instead adapted into 2 hours and 50 minutes worth of cinematic cutscenes, remastered in high definition.</Overview>

    <Overview>The setting of Knights Contract is in a fictional Europe during the Middle Ages, with dark fantasy characteristics, involving witchcraft, sorcery, and otherworldly monsters. A superstitious hatred for witches is the norm for society. As a result, people employ witch-hunters and witch-executioners. The game follows Heinrich Hofmann, an experienced witch-executioner plagued by a curse, and a young woman named Gretchen, who is the reincarnation of a witch Heinrich executed under the orders of Dr. Faust. In what initially seems an act of revenge for her execution, Gretchen curses Heinrich with immortality.

At the same time, Dr. Faust, the game's main antagonist, creates hordes of monsters that terrorize the world. The mad scientist is responsible for the deaths of Gretchen and her fellow witches. Gretchen, intending to protect humanity, decides to confront the menace directly, by joining forces with the cursed executioner, Heinrich. The now-immortal Heinrich is forced to protect the mortal Gretchen from danger, in hopes of undoing the curse and defeating Dr. Faust.</Overview>

    <Name>Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2010-09-28T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light is an action-adventure game developed by Crystal Dynamics and published by Square Enix for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and iOS through digital distribution. It is part of the Tomb Raider series, but unlike previous games, the game does not carry the Tomb Raider brand and has a heavy emphasis on cooperative gameplay. In multiplayer, players take the role as either Lara Croft or a 2,000-year-old Mayan warrior named Totec. They must work together in order to stop the evil spirit Xolotl and retrieve the Mirror of Smoke. A single-player campaign mode is available that does not include the non-playable character AI following or helping Lara.

In the United States and United Kingdom, Guardian of Light was released for the Xbox Live Arcade on 18 August 2010; it was released a month later on 28 September for PlayStation Network and Steam. Though local cooperative was available at the initial release for all versions, online cooperative was later added. In North America, on 16 December 2010, the video game was released for iOS devices which included cooperative with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth options. The first downloadable content (DLC) map pack was released for free for a limited time.

Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light was well received by critics. The Xbox 360 version of the game holds an average score of 85/100 and 86.36% on the game aggregate sites Metacritic and GameRankings, respectively. In September 2010, IGN listed Lara Croft and the Guardian of Light fourteenth in their top twenty-five Xbox Live Arcade titles of all time. Critics felt that the game was an excellent fit for Lara Croft.[2] Guardian of Light sold 98,000 copies on Xbox Live in its first six weeks,[3] and as of 22 August 2013, the game has sold more than 1 million copies on all platforms.[4] A sequel titled Lara Croft and the Temple of Osiris was released in 2014 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.[5]</Overview>

    <Name>Legend of Kay: Anniversary</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2015-06-28T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>For many generations, the mystical land of Yenching had been inhabited by many animals, mainly cats, hares, frogs, and pandas. Because of a religious code called the Way, these four races had prospered throughout the ages in their own separate towns. But as the years passed, the younger generations began to defect from the Way. Ultimately, with no protective code to guide the races, Yenching was invaded by the Gorillas and the Rats (known as the Din), led by Gorilla Minister Shun and Tak, the Rat Alchemist. Minister Shun now rules the majority of Yenching with an iron fist, and is said to reside in the volcanic mountain of Waa-Lo.

The story now focuses around a figure named Kay. Kay is a hotheaded young cat, and the Master's finest martial arts student. Like many of the people of the races, Kay does not believe in the Way, and likes to focus on physical skills and strength. This is what makes his friend, Su Ling, leave his town in disgust, hoping to find another town that would share her belief in resurrecting the Way. One day, in Kay's martial arts school, Shun's gorillas and the mayor of Kay's town declare that they must shut down the school because new 'Din schools' must soon be erected in the town. Kay is outraged, and even more so when his Master simply agrees to the new terms. And so, making up his mind, Kay sneaks into his Master's house at night (the Master is drunk, and asleep) and steals the mystical blade the Master keeps. Kay then jumps out of the town walls, and makes his way into the wilderness.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2008-06-03T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Lego Indiana Jones: The Original Adventures is a 2008 video game developed by Traveller's Tales and published by LucasArts.[7] The game allows players to recreate moments (albeit more humorously) from the first three Indiana Jones films: Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom (1984), and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1989). It features the same drop in/out co-operative play mode as seen in the Lego Star Wars video games, although it is restricted to local console play. The game was released on June 3, 2008 in the United States and Canada, and June 6, 2008 in Europe. A downloadable demo for Windows was made available on May 13, 2008. This game is based on the Lego Indiana Jones toy line. The Mac OS X version of the game was released on December 4, 2008 by Feral Interactive.[1]

As introduced in Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga, new moves include clinging onto branches during a jump using Indy's whip.[8] As a promotion, Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga features Indy as an unlockable playable character.[9]

The game often follows the events in the films, however like the Lego Star Wars series, some scenes from the film have been altered to become more family friendly or just provide comic relief to the player</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2009-11-03T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Lego Rock Band is a music video game, part of the Rock Band series developed by Harmonix, that incorporates elements from Lego video games developed by Traveller's Tales. The game is published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment and MTV Games. The game was released on November 3, 2009 for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and Wii home consoles in the United States.[1] A Nintendo DS version was also developed in conjunction with Backbone Entertainment.

The game, as with other games in the Rock Band series, allows up to four players to use instrument controllers to play lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals on a number of rock music songs. In addition, aspects of building with Lego bricks are incorporated into the game, allowing players to customize their avatars and other band assistants, and include additional Lego-themed gameplay modes. The gameplay and the game's 45-song soundtrack has been selected to create a "family-friendly" game. Players are able to export the songs from the game into other Rock Band titles, while downloadable content that passes family-friendly filters can be incorporated into the game; however, songs released after Rock Band 3 are not compatible due to changes in the song format.[2]

Lego Rock Band was met with moderate reviews, which praised the inclusion of both the Rock Band and Lego video game aspects incorporated into the game, but questioned some selections on the game's soundtrack and some features that would be at odds with the target audience of the game.</Overview>

    <Name>Lemmings</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2006-12-07T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Lemmings is a puzzle-platformer video game originally developed by DMA Design and first published by Psygnosis for the Amiga, Atari ST and PC in 1991. The game was programmed by Mike Dailly and David Jones, and was inspired by a simple animation that Dailly created while experimenting with Deluxe Paint.

The objective of the game is to guide a group of anthropomorphized lemmings through a number of obstacles to a designated exit. In order to save the required number of lemmings to win, one must determine how to assign a limited number of eight different skills to specific lemmings that allow the selected lemming to alter the landscape, to affect the behavior of other lemmings, or to clear obstacles in order to create a safe passage for the rest of the lemmings.

Lemmings was one of the best-received video games of the early 1990s. It was the second highest rated game in the history of Amstrad Action, and was considered the eighth greatest game of all time by Next Generation in 1996. Lemmings is also one of the most widely ported video games, and is estimated to have sold over 15 million copies between its various ports. The popularity of the game also led to the creation of several sequels, remakes and spin-offs, and has also inspired similar games.</Overview>

    <Overview>Imagine a world that's yours to shape, build and explore. Imagine the possibilities, then jump head first into the reality. LittleBigPlanet puts the power of absolute creation into your own hands. If you can see it, you can enhance it. If you can't see it, you can invent it. 

The LittleBigPlanet experience starts with players learning about their character's powers to interact physically with the environment. There are places to explore, creative resources to collect and puzzles to solve - all requiring a combination of brains and collaborative teamwork. As soon as players begin, their creative skills will grow and they will soon be ready to start creating and modifying their surroundings - the first step to sharing them with the whole community. 

Players can make their world as open or as secretive to explore as they like. When it's ready, they can invite anyone within the LittleBigPlanet community to come and explore their patch - or can go and explore everybody else's.</Overview>

    <Name>Madagascar Kartz</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-10-23T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Madagascar Kartz is a racing game based on DreamWorks Animation's Madagascar. It was released on October 27, 2009 and the second game on Madagascar's spin-off series.

Gameplay[edit]
The game is a basic kart racing game, and the player can perform jumps, flips, rolls.[1] There are many different stages from scenes of the franchise.[1] Playable characters include Alex, Marty, Gloria, Melman, King Julien, Mason and Phil, or all four of the penguins.[1] The Madagascar Kartz Wheel is bundled with the Wii version of the game. This wheel is optional. This wheel's look is different from that of the Wii Wheel from Mario Kart Wii.[1]

Playable characters include Alex the Lion, Marty the Zebra, Melman the Giraffe, Gloria the Hippotamus, The Penguins, The Chimps, and King Julien from the Madagascar. Two characters from other movies are included alongside the Madagascar, Shrek from Shrek, and B.O.B. from Monsters vs. Aliens, all DreamWorks Animation franchises. Race types include Quick Race, Championship, Time Trial and Checkpoint race. A Championship race is one where the player collects mangoes and tries to finish first place in order to unlock higher speed classes (50cc, 100cc, 150cc, 200cc, the last one is raced in reverse direction/mirror mode), more karts and tracks. In Time Trial, players beat their own times and earn medals (gold, silver and bronze). In Checkpoint Race, players collect as many hourglasses as they can before the time runs out. There are several tracks in the game. Also, in a track, most tracks have 2 shortcuts. "I Like to Move It", sung by Reel 2 Real, is the menu theme. The game's gameplay is similar to those of Mario Kart Wii, by Nintendo. The sequel is Super Star Kartz.</Overview>

    <Overview>Madden NFL 25 is an American football sports video game based on the National Football League and published by EA Sports. It was released for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in late August 2013. Instead of numbering it Madden NFL 14 with the year like in previous versions of the Madden NFL games, the "25" in the title refers the 25th anniversary of the series.[1] The eighth generation console versions of Madden NFL 25 are the very first games to run on EA Sports's Ignite game engine. However, the seventh generation versions still run on EA's previous game engine. The standard versions feature former Detroit Lions running back Barry Sanders, on the cover. The eight-generation versions feature Minnesota Vikings running back, Adrian Peterson, on the cover. The eighth-generation versions were released as launch titles for the PlayStation 4 on November 15, 2013, and Xbox One on November 22, 2013.</Overview>

    <Name>Magic: The Gathering: Duels of the Planeswalkers 2014</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2013-06-25T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Magic 2014 is a trading card game based on the physical game Magic: The Gathering. The basic gist is that players participate in turn-based combat in which each opponent plays out cards from the deck (a combination of playing cards). Those cards either generate mana (there are five kind of manas) or summons (require mana to play out) which have different abilities. The goal is to reduce the opponent's life points to zero.

During the campaign, the player helps out a planeswalker named Chandra Nalaar who chases evil wizards through the multiverse. From a gameplay perspective, it is a series of fights against specialised enemies which over time unlocks ten decks. Other available single-player modes are challenges, the new sealed mode and quick matches against the AI. Multiplayer consists of ranked matches or two-against-two matches with up to four human players (the latter is a singleplayer mode in the mobile versions).

In the sealed mode, the game gives out random booster packs which can be used to build a deck - two decks can be built for free; more booster packs are available via micro transactions. There is also an extra campaign to try out the new deck, but it can also be used in multiplayer. Besides this mode and additional cards, there are no differences to the predecessor.

The mobile versions are distributed for free, but only include a part of the content (three decks, a part of the singleplayer campaign, sealed mode and a planeswalker duel). The rest of the content has to be unlocked with a micro-transaction.</Overview>

    <Overview>Mass Effect is set in the year 2183 AD. Thirty-five years prior, humankind discovered a cache of technology on Mars, supposedly built by a technologically advanced but long-extinct race called the Protheans. Studying and adapting this technology, humanity has managed to break free of the solar system and has established numerous colonies and encountered various extraterrestrial species within the Milky Way galaxy. Utilizing alien artifacts known as Mass Relays, the various space-faring races are able to travel instantly across vast stretches of the galaxy. Within the game, humanity has formed the Human Systems Alliance, one of many independent bodies that make up the collective of "Citadel space". The Human Systems Alliance is a rising power in the galactic stage. The only war they have participated in was the "First Contact War" in 2157. A human exploration expedition was activating dormant mass relays (which was a practice considered unsafe by citadel races). The turians attacked the small fleet and proceeded to capture the closest human world, Shanxi. The turians proceeded to starve out the remaining humans and occupy the planet. Facing starvation the human garrison surrendered to the Turian Hierarchy. One month later, the human Second Fleet responded by annihilating the turian fleet around Shanxi. In response the turians prepared for full scale war. The citadel council saw that humanity would either be annihilated or annexed by the turians and stepped in. The humans were then given an embassy in the Citadel Council. Citadel space, as a whole, is ruled by a body of government known as the Council, which is made up of members of the three prominent alien races: the asari, a race of mono-gendered aliens which closely resemble blue-skinned human females; the short-lived salarians; and the raptor-like turians. Other alien species seen in the game include the reptilian krogan, the four-eyed, humanoid batarians, the aquatic hanar, and the methodical and quadrupedal elcor, and the environmental-suited quarians and volus. Dozens of other aliens are asserted to exist throughout the galaxy, but are not seen or mentioned in the game. The game takes place primarily in two locations: the prototype frigate SSV Normandy, and the Citadel, a gigantic, ancient space station purportedly built by the Protheans and which currently acts as the center of galactic civilization. Throughout the game, however, the player may navigate the Normandy to various planets, moons and other destinations.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2012-05-15T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Max Payne 3 is the third installment in Rockstar Games Max Payne series and is set eight years after the events of the last installment. No longer a cop, Max is close to washed-up, drunk and addicted to painkillers. Without a job on the force, Max has left the greater New York area, and finds himself in Sao Paulo, Brazil, working as private security. The story of Max's descent from vengeful, leather-jacket wearing detective roaming the alleys of New York to the broken, shaven-headed man out for justice on unfamiliar streets far from home is at the center of Max Payne 3. In addition to Max's classic shoot-dodge moves, there is now a combination of Natural Motion's Euphoria character behavior system and Bullet Time to enhance his moves. Partners and sidekicks will play a large role in this game to help Max in his quest for vengeance.</Overview>

    <Name>Mayhem</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-03-25T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Mayhem is a fast paced arcade racing and car destruction game. The inspiration for the game comes from two distinct types of events: Demolition Derby and Banger Racing. A demolition derby is more of an American pastime, primarily at state fairs and the like. Participants take an old beat down car, strip it of all the glass and other "dangerous" elements, spray paint the car and decorate it to their liking, then beat it to death at the main event. The last vehicle standing is the victor. A Banger Race is more practiced in the UK. Races take place on small courses with pits and hills, and drivers are encouraged to send their opponents off course. Courses can have hazards and obstacles, and the "figure 8" shaped course is a staple of the race. No matter whether it's Banger races or demolition derbys, the fact is that everyone love to see the everyman take it to the mat and come out a victor, and that's what Mayhem is all about.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2010-10-12T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Operating directly under the National Command Authority, a relatively unknown entity of handpicked warriors are called on when the mission must not fail. They are the Tier 1 Operators.

Over 2 million Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Marines wear the uniform. Of those, approximately 50 thousand fall under the direct control of the Special Operations Command. The Tier 1 Operator functions on a plane of existence above and beyond even the most highly trained Special Operations Forces. Their exact numbers, while classified, hover in the low hundreds. They are living, breathing, precision instruments of war. They are experts in the application of violence. The new Medal of Honor is inspired by and has been developed with Tier 1 Operators from this elite community. Players will step into the boots of these warriors and apply their unique skill sets to a new enemy in the most unforgiving and hostile battlefield conditions of present day Afghanistan. There is a new enemy. There is a new war. There is a new warrior. He is Tier 1.</Overview>

    <Overview>The Nazi invasion is in full swing, and you're the Lieutenant who's going to put a stop to it. Step into the shoes of Lt. Jimmy Patterson once again, sweeping across Europe to rescue the innocent and destroy the opposition. The 15 assignments range from saving captured OSS operatives from a Nazi-held Dutch manor house to dismantling a German naval base. Of course, all of the action takes place in detailed 3D; featuring some of the more amazing graphics you'll ever lay eyes on. Your job is a little too tough for any one man to pull off on his own, so you'll have a loyal group of soldiers and a slew of weaponry including the Liberator Pistol, Panzerschreck, MG42, and B.A.R. all of which will come to your aid in the heat of battle. Divided into five main missions, the gameplay is extensive and meticulously constructed, resulting in an experience that trumps earlier series installments.</Overview>

    <Name>Medal of Honor: Airborne</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2007-11-19T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Medal of Honor: Airborne is a World War II first-person shooter video game and the 11th installment of the Medal of Honor series. It was developed by EA LA and was released worldwide on Mobile phones in August 2007,[1] and on Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 in September 2007. Versions for the PlayStation 2, Wii, and Xbox were planned but they were cancelled in 2007.[5] Instead, Medal of Honor: Vanguard was released exclusively for the first two consoles. A PlayStation 3 version was released November 2007.[6] The game takes place in the European theater of World War II, and is the first in the series to focus only on paratrooper activities.[7]

In the single-player mode, the player takes on the role of PFC/CPL Boyd Travers, a fictional paratrooper in the US 82nd Airborne Division.[8] Missions include various insertions into Italy, northern France, the Netherlands and Germany, each one beginning with a jump behind enemy lines. Airborne also features a multiplayer mode available for online play, where users have the choice of fighting for the Allies and parachuting down to the battlefield, or fighting for the Axis and starting on the ground, defending the position from enemy paratroopers.

The game uses a massively improved version of Unreal Engine 3.[9] Airborne employs a nonlinear gameplay style whereby the player can start the game anywhere in the map by directing where they land, as opposed to previous linear FPS games where the start point and direction is already laid out, such as Allied Assault.[10]</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2008-08-31T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Mercenaries 2: World in Flames is an explosive open-world action game set in a massive, highly reactive, war-torn world. A power-hungry tyrant messes with Venezuela's oil supply, sparking an invasion that turns the country into a warzone. But for you, international crisis is all upside: You are a mercenary, and you profit from chaos. Mercenaries 2 features a slew of potential clients, all willing to pay you to do their dirty work. Dirty deeds, done for exorbitant fees. These are world powers with deep pockets, deep grudges, and enough arms and ammo to start World War III. This is your kind of environment. Mercenaries 2 features the latest and most dangerous in civilian and military tech, everything from shiny new sports cars, to the future-tech satellite-guided bunker-busting mini-nuke. Tanks, APCs, boats, luxury automobiles - you name it, you can have it delivered to you in real time. And if you run out of cash you can always 'acquire' the gear you need in the field. If you see it, you can buy it, steal it, or blow the living crap out of it. Play your own way, or play with the help of a friend in the new cooperative multiplayer mode. You are not a soldier. You don't have to play by anyone's rules. You have your own code: you will fulfill the terms of the contract, no matter what. Not everyone in the world of Mercenaries is as honorable. Everyone will try and screw you, given the chance. They think they can get away with it, because they don't know rule #1: EVERYBODY PAYS.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2013-02-19T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>METAL GEAR RISING: REVENGEANCE takes the renowned METAL GEAR franchise into exciting new territory by focusing on delivering an all-new action experience unlike anything that has come before. Combining world-class development teams at Kojima Productions and PlatinumGames, METAL GEAR RISING: REVENGEANCE brings two of the world's most respected teams together with a common goal of providing players with a fresh synergetic experience that combines the best elements of pure action and epic storytelling, all within the expansive MG universe. The game introduces Raiden as the central character; a child soldier transformed into a half-man, half-machine cyborg ninja, equipped with a high-frequency katana blade and a soul fueled by revenge.

In the near future, cyborg technology has become commonplace throughout society. Three years have passed since the collapse of the Patriots system that had been secretly controlling the global power balance from the shadows. However, peace remains elusive. The dissemination of cybernetic technology has triggered instability and conflict as those who control the trade gain increasing power. Furthermore, large 'Private Military Companies', or PMC's, that had been supported and controlled by the Patriots have collapsed, spawning countless rogue entities with origins to larger criminal organizations. These renegade PMCs employing cyborg technology have become increasingly more disruptive shifting policy and power at will. As a member of the peace-keeping PMC 'Maverick Security', Raiden lives by the mantra of protecting and saving lives. But as the world plunges further into asymmetric warfare, the only path that leads him forward is rooted in resolving his past, and carving through anything that stands in his way.</Overview>

    <Name>Metal Gear Solid HD Collection</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-11-08T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>From the critically acclaimed director, Hideo Kojima, Metal Gear Solid HD Collection offers a handful of the most popular Metal Gear Solid titles from the past in true HD for the first time ever. Featuring three complete games, Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty, Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater and Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, the HD Collection offers old and new fans a chance to experience the epic game play, design and storytelling of the MGS franchise. The "Metal Gear Solid (MGS)" series is the seminal work of Hideo Kojima, Japan's master game creator, and the progenitor of the stealth action game genre. The series has become a global phenomenon, with over 27 million copies sold worldwide. The player controls a secret agent from an elite special forces unit who is sent on solo sneaking missions through enemy installations, vast jungles, and sometimes even the thick of battle. Alone and surrounded by the enemy, even a special forces agent will find it tough to come out alive. But that is the secret behind the series' popularity-the cerebral challenge of figuring out how to avoid combat, and the thrill of sneaking through enemy territory undetected. The MGS series is also known for its storyline, which blends seamlessly with the gameplay. The scenarios are based on extensive research and incorporate the drama of actual developments in society. These elements have made MGS what it is today: a mature work of entertainment that transcends national borders and the confines of video games, and one of the leading products of the Japanese content business.</Overview>

    <Name>Metro: Last Light - Limited Edition</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2013-05-14T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Metro: Last Light (also known as Metro 2033: A Light of Hope in Russia) is a single-player post-apocalyptic-themed first-person shooter video game with stealth and survival horror elements, developed by Ukrainian studio 4A Games and published by Deep Silver for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in May 2013.[1] PlayStation 4 and Xbox One versions of the game were released August 26, 2014.

The game is set in a post-apocalyptic Moscow, part of the universe of the novel Metro 2033 and its sequels, written by Russian author Dmitry Glukhovsky, but does not follow any direct storylines from the books. Previously announced as Metro 2034,[2] the game is a sequel to the video game Metro 2033, and although Glukhovsky did work with developer 4A Games, it bears no relation to the book Metro 2034. Rumors on his website point to the upcoming book, Metro 2035, to be a novelization of Metro: Last Light, but it will cover the plot and dialogue in much greater detail and length.

Initially, the game was to be published under THQ and expected to be released in the middle of 2012;[3] it was announced on February 2, 2012, that the game would be delayed until the first quarter of 2013, and on March 1, 2013 the game was delayed again until May. Following THQ's closure in January 2013, the intellectual property was acquired by video game publisher Deep Silver.

Metro: Last Light received positive reviews from critics. Praise was directed at the game's story (including its atmosphere, presentation, and environments), graphics (especially on Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One), and the improvements made over Metro 2033 (such as the controls, gunplay, sound, and stealth mechanics). The game did, however, draw some criticism for its linear sequences, AI, and technical issues.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2011-04-12T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>After enjoying chart-topping success on Wii, Ubisoft's Michael Jackson: The Experience moonwalks over to the motion-sensing Kinect and PlayStation Move peripherals. The Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 versions offer ability to sing as well as dance, allowing users to create the complete concert experience. Other key features are specific to each platform. PlayStation Move owners, for example, can automatically post their performance progress and even pictures of themselves to Facebook. Features will scale based on the type of equipment detected, so players with microphones and not the PlayStation Move can still sing along to the music. Like the Kinect version, the PlayStation Move lets players view themselves on the screen along with the dancers. In addition to the soundtrack from the Wii version, the PlayStation 3 game includes a number of exclusive tracks, from "Blood on the Dance Floor" to "I Just Can't Stop Loving You."</Overview>

    <Overview>MicroBot is a twin-stick shooter video game developed by Naked Sky Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts. It was released on the Xbox 360 via Xbox Live Arcade on December 29, 2010 and on PlayStation 3 via the PlayStation Network on January 4, 2011. In the game the player controls a MicroBot; a microscopic robot designed to combat infections in the human body. The robot is tasked with destroying previous generation MicroBots which have become corrupted while fighting disease in the body.

Critics were divided on their opinions of the game, but overall review scores were moderate. Aggregate scores averaged in the 60% range for both platforms at websites GameRankings and Metacritic. Most reviewers praised the game's visual and audio presentation. They felt that the environments were convincing as areas of the body and that the soundtrack was strong. Critics differed in opinion in regards to gameplay; many praised the addition of local cooperative play and the ability to upgrade the MicroBot with new weaponry and features, but many felt the game did not add enough new gameplay elements to the genre to keep the player interested long-term.</Overview>

    <Overview>Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor is an action-packed adventure-RPG inspired by J.R.R. Tolkien's The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings. Exploring an original story of vengeance and redemption, the game puts players in the role of Talion, a valiant ranger whose family is slain in front of him the night Sauron and his army return to Mordor -- moments before his own life is taken.

Through the course of his personal vendetta, Talion uncovers the truth of the Spirit that compels him, learns the origins of the Rings of Power and ultimately confronts his true nemesis.

Every enemy that players face is a unique individual, differentiated by their personality, strengths and weaknesses. Through the Nemesis System, enemy relationships and characteristics are shaped by player actions and decisions to create personal archenemies that remember and adapt to the player and are distinct to every gameplay session. Gamers are able to craft their own battles, enemies and rewards within the dynamic world that remembers and adapts to their choices, delivering a unique experience to every player.</Overview>

    <Name>MLB 12: The Show</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2012-03-06T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>After a productive off-season, Sony's critically acclaimed baseball sim heads into spring training in the best shape of its life thanks to a focus on more realistic presentation and physics, new and improved game modes, cross-platform support, and full PlayStation Move integration in MLB 12: The Show. The new "TruBroadcast" feature makes a point of focusing on player reactions, the in-game commentary now includes more season-specific discussions, and a completely revamped baseball physics engine results in more realistic bounces and bloops than ever before.

MLB 12's "Franchise" mode has been tweaked to produce more plausible trade scenarios, so rebuilding teams will be more likely to acquire prospects while contenders will seek impact veterans. Draft-eligible position players now reflect traditional baseball archetypes, such as a slugging first baseman or an all-glove shortstop, while computer-generated pitchers now have more realistic pitch repertoires -- no more power pitchers who also throw baffling knuckleballs. New minor adjustments include customized "Play Now" matches and settings that remain fixed across all modes.

The biggest addition in MLB 12: The Show is the "Diamond Dynasty" mode, which allows gamers to manage their own custom online team, recruit star players, and take on other custom online teams to earn development points. PlayStation Move controls have been fully integrated in MLB 12, allowing players to pitch, run, field, and hit using their Move Motion Controller across all game modes. And gamers on the go can now cloud save their "Franchise," "Season," and "Road to the Show" data, then access it and continue playing from either their PS3 or PlayStation Vita.</Overview>

    <Overview>MLB Front Office Manager allows a player to take the role of a baseball general manager over the course of a thirty-year career; the goal is to perform well enough to become inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame. The player's GM is rated on eight disciplines including North American scouting, international scouting, pro-league scouting, player development, trades, contract negotiation, owner confidence and leadership. GMs also have former career backgrounds (i.e. ex-manager, lawyer, business person, former player, or talent scout) that affect the GM's disciplines. A GM's ratings improve or regress over his career depending on their performance and will have seasonal goals depending on the club they're hired by. The player will be faced with decisions such as spring training evaluation, initiate and respond to trades, develop rookies, and even bid for Japanese baseball players. The game also promises advanced AI-controlled GMs who have unique motivations.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2006-11-13T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Featuring a variety of Mobile Suits from the Gundam franchise, "Mobile Suit Gundam" sets players in the latter stages of The One Year War. Players have the opportunity to be a commander of their own Mobile Suit battalion for either the Federation or Zeon Mobile Suit Assault Force. As players move through the ranks, they are able to gain access to new Mobile Suits and engage in battles with more capable pilots at their command.

With a battalion at their disposal, players face a number of strategic options to choose from. In order to succeed, it will be vital for players to know about specific destructible parts on Mobile Suits, vulnerable enemy facilities and whether or not to engage enemies with either short or long range combat. Teamwork will also be a key component to the survival of every mission. If players are successful, their chosen allegiance could be the turning point for the war in Mobile Suit Gundam.</Overview>

    <Name>Monkey Island 2 Special Edition: LeChuck's Revenge</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2010-07-06T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Monkey Island 2: LeChuck's Revenge is an adventure game developed and published by LucasArts in 1991. It was the second game of the Monkey Island series, following The Secret of Monkey Island, and the sixth LucasArts game to use the SCUMM engine. It was the first game to use the iMUSE sound system.

The game's story centers on the wannabe pirate Guybrush Threepwood. After defeating ghost pirate LeChuck in The Secret of Monkey Island, little is known of what happened between Guybrush Threepwood and Elaine Marley. The sequel involves Guybrush's attempts to find the mysterious treasure of Big Whoop.

The development team for Monkey Island 2 was largely the same as for the first game in the series. The project was led by Ron Gilbert, and he was once more joined by Tim Schafer and Dave Grossman. The game was a critical and commercial success. Its HD remake was released in 2010.</Overview>

    <Name>Monopoly</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2008-10-20T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>There have been more than a dozen video game adaptations of Parker Brothers and Hasbro's highly successful board game Monopoly.


A PlayStation version was developed by Gremlin Interactive, whilst a Windows/Mac version was by Westwood Studios. The Windows/Mac version played top down, while the PlayStation version was in 3D. They both had cutscenes in common, played when showing the game pieces moving on their own.[citation needed] In 1998, Hasbro Interactive released a Monopoly video game for Microsoft Windows, which used 3D graphics instead of the top-down design used in previous versions. It ran on Windows 95 (although can be run on up to Windows XP, but won't work on Windows Vista and up) and had a special online play feature which used a modem.[citation needed]

A new version developed by Electronic Arts was released in 2008 for the Wii, PlayStation 3, iPhone and Xbox 360, with a slightly stripped-down version for the PlayStation 2. It includes a transatlantic selection of boards, including the new Here &amp; Now edition boards and new game mode, Richest. There are no online features, however.[citation needed] EA's Monopoly game scored fairly poorly, with a 54% average on the PS3 on Metacritic,[2] and 56% on the Xbox 360.[3] The Wii version fared better with 70%.[4] The Official Nintendo Magazine in the UK were most positive in their evaluation of the Wii version, which they called "great fun" in the Christmas 2008 issue.[5] EuroGamer was less enthusiastic, saying: "For the price of Monopoly for Wii, you could buy real Monopoly. Twice. Or you could just buy no Monopoly at all and spend the money on something more likely to inspire amity and harmony, like a book by Hitler."[6]

The Monopoly Family Fun Pack, produced by Ubisoft for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, was released on November 18, 2014.[7] It is an on-disc bundle consisting of the digitally-released Monopoly Plus and Monopoly Deal, as well as Monopoly Plus 's My Monopoly extension.</Overview>

    <Name>Mortal Kombat X</Name>
    <Overview>Mortal Kombat X[b] is a fighting video game developed by NetherRealm Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. It is the tenth main installment in the Mortal Kombat video game series and was released on April 14, 2015 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One. NetherRealm studio's mobile team developed a version for iOS and Android devices. Versions for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 were originally planned for release, but both were later cancelled. Mortal Kombat X was officially announced in June 2014.

Like previous Mortal Kombat games, Mortal Kombat X '​s gameplay consists of two players, or one player and the CPU, fighting against each other with their selected character, using a large, varied array of character specific attacks. The game contains several modes, such as a story mode, which takes place twenty years after the previous Mortal Kombat game, several 'Tower' modes, which feature dynamically changing challenges, numerous online modes, and the 'Krypt', a mode played in a first-person perspective where players explore the areas unlocking a variety of in-game items.

The console versions of Mortal Kombat X received mostly positive reviews from critics upon release. Most praise was directed at the game's controls, overall gameplay, graphics, story, and characters, with some reviewers calling it the best game in the Mortal Kombat series. However, the PC version of the game was met with a negative reception, with reviewers blaming numerous technical issues for severely hindering the experience. Some critics particularly disliked the tutorials, microtransactions, downloadable content, regular crashes and online playability.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2007-07-23T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>NASCAR 08 is the eleventh installment of the EA Sports NASCAR series. It was developed by EA Tiburon and released for PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. This is the earliest that EA has released a NASCAR game. It also marks the first time the original Xbox has been excluded from the NASCAR lineup since NASCAR 2001.

Tony Stewart is on the cover marking his third appearance on the cover of an EA Sports NASCAR game. The cover in the PAL region features Juan Pablo Montoya. NASCAR's new Car of Tomorrow as well as the current car are present in the game, although the Car of Tomorrow is generic (no separate manufacturers). ESPN's NASCAR coverage is also integrated into the game. Crew chief dialogue for the PS3 and 360 versions of the game was recorded by Chad Knaus. The Whelen Modified Tour is not included in the PS3 and 360 versions of the game, but is still present in the PS2 version.</Overview>

    <Overview>NASCAR 09 is the twelfth installment in the EA Sports NASCAR series, it is the sequel to 2007 game NASCAR 08. It is developed by EA Tiburon and released on the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and mobile phones in North America on June 10, 2008.[1] On March 12, 2008, EA announced Jeff Gordon as the cover athlete for NASCAR 09.[2] Through the career mode, "Chase for the NASCAR Sprint Cup", Gordon leads a mentoring program,[3] a new feature offered in NASCAR 09.[4] This is also the third EA Sports NASCAR video game to appear on a handheld system for Mobile phone version.

In October 2007, Electronic Arts moved the PlayStation 2 game development to a new studio in North Carolina to be able to get better information with the NASCAR teams in an attempt to improve the game. The PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of the game were still made at the old studio.[5]

Due to the development team using certain resources to work on key features in the game, no car manufacturers were present in this year's title.[6]

To date, this is the last NASCAR game to be produced by EA, and the last NASCAR game for the PlayStation 2, after suffering from slumping sales, the difficulty of installing new features, and the lack of popularity. In 2009, NASCAR Kart Racing was released, replacing any 2009 installment for the annual series. It may be EA's last game before their exclusive license with NASCAR expires. Yet the door to NASCAR games for the PlayStation 2 has been shut, as Polyphony Digital's Gran Turismo 5 was not featured for the sixth-generation console.

For game players in Canada, while the game was still released only in English, the instruction manual and box cover were bilingual, with text in both English and French.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2011-11-01T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>NASCAR Unleashed is an arcade-style racing game that puts superstar drivers on real-world roads, with races run in famous venues such as Daytona, Martinsville, and Chicagoland -- and out in the surrounding city streets, as well. Behind the wheel as Kyle Busch, Dale Earnhardt Jr., Jeff Gordon, or one of a dozen others, players take the power and speed of NASCAR for an off-track joyride. Forgiving physics and accelerated action encourage players to trade paint as they push fearlessly to the front of the pack, while authentic techniques such as drafting or sling-shotting earn an extra boost.</Overview>

NBA 2K8 was well received upon release. Critics mostly praised the aesthetical details, with particular praise directed towards the player animations, as well as the game mode options, and overall gameplay, more specifically, the post play, jump shooting, and well rounded accessibility. Most criticisms were concerning some gameplay inconsistencies, such as the defensive mechanics, and the unrealistic player tendencies, as well as the game's lack of improvements, with some seeing the lack of meaningful changes as a step back from NBA 2K7, and visuals, which some saw as "awful" and "ugly". Some saw the visuals as "gorgeous" however.</Overview>

    <Name>NBA Elite 11 </Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2013-06-14T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>NBA Elite 11 is a basketball video game developed for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 by EA Canada and published by EA Sports, originally slated for an October 2010 release. Aiming at a refreshing gameplay experience, with changes that would include new mechanics and game modes, EA Sports opted to drop their long-standing "NBA Live" franchise moniker – used since the 1994 installment NBA Live '95 – in favor of a new identity, "NBA Elite", reflecting the publishers' desire to “pioneer a groundbreaking change in the basketball videogame segment.”

Although the game's production went as far as seeing copies pressed and a demo released, concerns over the quality of the product resulted in its release being delayed and, weeks later, officially cancelled. Since a limited number of physical copies of the PlayStation 3 version made it to the hands of consumers, NBA Elite 11 is now considered one of the rarest games for the platform, with some copies being sold for thousands of dollars.</Overview>

    <Name>NCAA March Madness 08</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2007-12-11T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The NCAA Basketball (formerly NCAA March Madness) series was a College basketball game which was published by EA Sports from 1998 until 2009. After EA Sports' rival publisher 2K Sports cancelled its own college basketball game, College Hoops, in 2008, EA changed the name of the series from NCAA March Madness to NCAA College Basketball. The series was discontinued on February 10, 2010.[1]

Like other games based on NCAA sports, it could not feature the players' names (as that is against NCAA policy/rules), so only the players' numbers were used in the rosters. Users were able to edit the rosters, putting in the correct names for each team if they wished to do so. Many player last names were built into the in-game commentary, like in the NBA Live series.

Verne Lundquist, Brad Nessler, and Gus Johnson lent their voices for play-by-play in the games at various times. Lundquist was the original announcer, with Nessler taking over in the mid-2000s and Johnson joining him for the most recent game in the series. Bill Raftery and Dick Vitale were analysts. Raftery originally worked with Lundquist on their games and returned to work alongside Johnson for CBS-branded games in NCAA Basketball 10, while Vitale and Nessler joined the series at the same time.</Overview>

    <Name>Numblast</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-07-02T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Numblast is a downloadable puzzle game for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable. It was developed by SCE Japan Studio and published by Sony Computer Entertainment.
The game is played on an 8x8 grid. Each space on the grid is occupied by a Numblast cube bearing a number between one and four. Players control a 2x2 cursor which is used to rotate groups of four cubes either clockwise or counter-clockwise. When four or more of the same cube form a square, they turn red and rotate, and their number increases by one (four cycles back to one). If another square is then formed, the relevant cubes also turn red and rotate. This process continues until no new square is formed, at which point all the red cubes disappear and points are awarded (a "Numblast" occurs when the entire play area is cleared in the same combo). A few seconds later the empty spaces are filled with random cubes. If the player fails to clear a cube within a certain time, it will turn black, and if all cubes turn black, the game is over. If four black cubes of any number form a 2x2 square, that square cannot be rotated (although the individual cubes within the square can be rotated if the player's cursor covers at least one non-black cube). After a certain number of cubes have been cleared, a special star cube appears which can occupy any number. When the special cube is used as part of a square, it eliminates all cubes of whichever number the square is otherwise made up of.</Overview>

    <Name>Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath HD</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-12-27T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The premise of Oddworld: Stranger's Wrath is that the bounty hunter Stranger must earn moolah (in-game money) by tracking down outlaws with bounties on their heads and apprehending them, bringing them in dead or alive. The game utilizes both third and first-person perspectives. In third person, the player controls Stranger when travelling long distance, platform jumping, rope climbing and melee combat while first person is like that of first person shooter games where ranged weapons are used. Enemies can be approached head on like a straight up action game or stealthily by hiding in long grass out of enemy sight (as indicated via mini map) and luring foes away from or toward the player.[9] Once enemies are encountered, they can be killed or knocked down/stunned temporarily; in this state they can be captured, thus earning more moolah than if they had been captured dead.[10] Upon an attempted capture, Stranger is unable to perform other actions and thus is vulnerable. The player has two status bars, health and stamina. When damage is taken, the health bar drops; if it fully depletes, it will result in the death of Stranger. Stamina drops when the player performs actions like melee attacks or falls from a great height. While it refills itself over time, it can be used to shake off health-bar damage, thus healing the player, but draining the stamina quicker.[9]
One of the game's main features is Stranger's crossbow that is used in a first person perspective that uses live ammunition in the form of using small fictional versions of real creatures as projectiles for differing effects. Live ammunition can be bought from the game's vendors or found scattered throughout the game world. When acquired, two different kinds of ammo can be assigned to the crossbow at any given time for two kinds of firing attack.[3] There are nine critters in total that can be used as ammo, such as Stunkz for stunning large groups of enemies, Thudslugs that work as cannonballs, Boombats that work as rockets, and Bees that are fired at foes like an automatic rifle.[3]
The game incorporates many role-playing elements in the form of earning moolah with each bounty fulfilled allowing it to be spent on upgrades such as crossbow, ammunition, storage and armour upgrades and other items such as binoculars and knuckle dusters.[11]</Overview>

    <Name>Odin Sphere Leifthrasir</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2016-06-07T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>ATLUS &amp;amp; Vanillaware, the team behind the hit side-scrolling action game Dragon's Crown releases a new authentic HD project to recreate and perfect the PS2 classic Odin Sphere - a 2D action RPG with Norse Mythology roots. Told in five tales from the perspectives of five unique protagonists, Odin Sphere Leifthrasir expresses the original game with glorious HD graphics in Vanillaware's renowned style.

The kingdom of Valentine was the most powerful country on the continent of Erion. Its people thrived using the magical power of the Crystallization Cauldron, but it was destroyed in one fateful night. And so, a war over the now master-less Cauldron has begun, involving all the nations of the land and growing more intense by the day. Is the End near, as the Prophecy states?

HD Art Upgrade: Known for its beautiful, 2D hand-drawn art style, Odin Sphere is recreated in 1080p and 60FPS, making the vivid even more vivid and the beautiful more beautiful.
Redesigned for MORE ACTION: The controls and mechanics refined in Dragon's Crown have been fine-tuned and carried over to Odin Sphere Leifthrasir. New moves give the gameplay more fluidity and make the game feel better than ever before. All-new skill trees and an easy-to-use inventory system further refresh the experience.
New Stages and Enemies! Extra stages have been added, expanding the world of Odin Sphere. More than just gorgeous locales to be visited, new stages means new enemies to challenge!
Classics Don't Go Out of Style: Those who prefer the battle game play of the original Odin Sphere need not fret, as the classic game play will remain an option--without sacrificing the upgraded high-definition graphics.
Japanese and English voice-overs: Enjoy the original Japanese voices plus new English voices and text.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2014-08-26T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>OlliOlli is a 2D side-scrolling street skateboarding game with a pixel visual style. The player guides a skateboarder through different levels with many objectives to complete, such as reaching a certain score, performing a specific trick, catching air, pushing a limited amount of times, grinding specific objects, or getting certain landings. There are no enemies in the environment, so the focus is entirely on solo play performing tricks by jumping, doing spins, grabs, slides, flips, kicks, etc. The skater moves forward automatically and the player uses keys or buttons to spin left or right, jump, perform tricks, and also a key or button to control the landing. The amount of buttons is limited, but timing is important. Tricks can be linked together into combos.

The game has a minimalist look reminiscent of Canabalt. Messages in coloured boxes appear at the bottom screen for each trick or objective completed. Tracks have a limited distance and objectives need to be completed in the provided distance, but multiple objectives can be split over multiple sessions. There are five different environments (urban, junkyard, port, base, and neon city) with ten levels each. These are split up in five amateur and five pro levels, each with five objectives. Pro levels have more difficult objectives, for instance grabbing a certain item along the way. Later levels have more obstacles and hazards. Next to the career mode there is a spots mode. A spot is unlocked each time a level is completed. The spots mode is similar to the career mode, but requires a single, huge, uninterrupted combo to complete the challenge in a confined area. A third RAD Mode is initially locked. This mode offer challenges that can only be completed with perfect landings and grinds.

The game keeps track of the best times. There is a daily grind mode where players worldwide compete against each other on a new spot every day to get the highest score, but there is only one chance to compete per day. There are leaderboards (global and friends) and a tricktionary where all possible tricks are stored. The game also includes a tutorial.</Overview>

    <Overview>Overlord II is the sequel to the warped fantasy action adventure that had players being delightfully despotic. In Overlord II, a new Overlord and a more powerful army of Minions take on an entire empire in a truly epic adventure, inspired by the rise of the Roman Empire. As the Glorious Empire conquers kingdoms and destroys any sign of magic it finds, it's time to go Minion Maximus and send in the horde. The Minions return smarter, deadlier (and funnier) and are ready to fight in large scale battles that will see their wild pack mentality squaring up to the organised legions of the Glorious Empire. As ever, they'll do anything and everything the Overlord commands of them, especially now that they can run ravage and wreck buildings and scenery. They've also learned how to ride: In Overlord II Minions mount up and ride wolves and other magical creatures around the landscape and take them into battle, making our band of merry fighters faster and fiercer than ever before.</Overview>

    <Name>Overlord: Raising Hell</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2008-06-24T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Controlling a mysterious figure who has inherited the legacy of the evil, long-dead Overlord, the player emerges, near death, from the ruins of the old Overlord's Dark Tower. Only your actions determine if you will rise to become the new all-powerful Overlord; it's all down to how much of a fiend you want to be in order to succeed...evil or really evil! With plenty of black humor and dark irony, the game immerses players in twisted parodies of classic fantasy scenarios and characters. Overlord's key innovation is the introduction of an array of impish creatures: the minions. They believe you are the old Overlord reborn and will use their unique skills to fetch, fight, and die for you. Throughout the game, players actively control a horde of these gremlin-like critters, and they follow your every instruction no matter how despotic or, for the minions, life-threatening it is.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2017-04-04T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>A game about the internal and external conflicts of a group of troubled high school students - the protagonist and a collection of compatriots he meets in the game's story - who live dual lives as Phantom Thieves. They have the typically ordinary day-to-day of a Tokyo high schooler: attending class, after-school activities, and part-time jobs. But they also undertake fantastical adventures by using otherworldly powers to enter the hearts of people. Their power comes from the Persona, the Jungian concept of the "self"; the game's heroes realize that society forces people to wear masks to protect their inner vulnerabilities, and by literally ripping off their protective mask and confronting their inner selves do the heroes awaken their inner power, and using it to help those in need. Ultimately, the group of Phantom Thieves seeks to change their day-to-day world to match their perception and see through the masks modern society wears.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2009-12-10T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>In PixelJunk Shooter, players pilot a subterranean vehicle to explore the interior of diverse cave-like complexes. The player must affect the surrounding and dynamic terrain to progress. The goal is to safely navigate through each vivid stage and rescue survivors scattered about the cavernous environment. Each stage is in-effect a flow simulation whereby the player attempts to control various types of liquid (water, magma, etc) and solid matter (rock, earth) either by destroying it, manipulating it or moving it. These dynamic fluid effects are at the heart of the games visuals. Strategy is paramount in PixelJunk Shooter. The piloted craft is susceptible to extremes of heat, so the player must be careful about the craft's proximity to magma. If the craft becomes too hot, the player can regain a comfortable temperature by plunging into the nearest water source. Additionally, each stage presents a puzzle scenario for the player to solve in order to safely rescue as many survivors as possible. Both environmental elements and enemies, including Bosses, will attempt to hamper the player's progress.</Overview>

    <Name>Portal 2</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-04-19T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Portal 2 is a 2011 first-person puzzle-platform video game developed and published by Valve Corporation. It is the sequel to Portal (2007) and was released on April 19, 2011, for Microsoft Windows, OS X, Linux, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360. The retail versions of the game are distributed by Electronic Arts while online distribution of the Windows, OS X and Linux versions is handled by Valve's content delivery service Steam. Portal 2 was announced on March 5, 2010, following a week-long alternate reality game based on new patches to the original game. Before the game's release on Steam, the company released the Potato Sack, a second multi-week alternate reality game, involving 13 independently developed titles which culminated in a distributed computing spoof to release Portal 2 several hours early.

The game retains Portal‍ '​s gameplay elements, and adds new features, including tractor beams, laser redirection, bridges made of light, and paint-like 'gels' accelerating the player's speed, allowing the player-character to jump higher or place portals on any surface. These gels were created by the team from the Independent Games Festival-winning DigiPen student project Tag: The Power of Paint. In the single-player campaign, the player controls protagonist Chell, awoken from suspended animation after many years, who must navigate the now-dilapidated Aperture Science Enrichment Center during its reconstruction by the reactivated GLaDOS, a powerful supercomputer. The storyline introduces new characters, including Wheatley (Stephen Merchant) and Cave Johnson (J. K. Simmons). Ellen McLain reprised the role of GLaDOS. Jonathan Coulton and The National each produced a song for the game. Portal 2 also includes a two-player cooperative mode, in which the robotic player-characters Atlas and P-Body are each given a portal gun and are required to work together to solve puzzles. Valve provided post-release support for the game, including additional downloadable content and a simplified map editor to allow players to create and share test chambers with others.

Although some reviewers initially expressed concerns about the difficulty of expanding Portal into a full sequel, Portal 2 received critical acclaim, particularly for its writing, pacing, and dark humor. The voice work of McLain, Merchant, and Simmons were also praised, as were the new gameplay elements, the challenging but surmountable learning curve, and the additional cooperative mode. Some journalists ranked Portal 2 among the best games of 2011, and several named it their Game of the Year. Portal 2 has since been hailed as one of the greatest video games of all time.</Overview>

    <Name>Pro Evolution Soccer 2008</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2007-10-26T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Pro Evolution Soccer 2008[1] (officially abbreviated as PES 2008 and known as World Soccer: Winning Eleven 2008 in Korea and Japan, sometimes called World Soccer: Winning Eleven 11 in PS2) is an association football video game in the Pro Evolution Soccer series by Konami. The game was officially announced on 18 June 2007. Its title is different from the other Pro Evolution Soccer games in that it's of a year and not a version; this was due to EA Sports' FIFA series naming their titles with two digit numbers (i.e. 07, 08) and in conclusion would seem that PES was a year behind FIFA (to non-fans which had no knowledge of the previous games of the franchise).

It was released for Windows, Wii, Nintendo DS, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Xbox 360 and mobile phone.

A PS3 demo is available for download from the PlayStation Store,[3] a Xbox 360 demo has been released on the Xbox Live Marketplace,[4] and a PC demo has been released.[5]</Overview>

The game is a crossover between the Puyo Puyo series and the Tetris franchise, and features various gameplay modes incorporating both aspects.

Puyo Puyo Tetris was the first Tetris-related title published by Sega since Tetris Collection, an installment in the Sega Ages series, in 2006, eight years prior. Puyo Puyo Tetris adopts the guidelines used in current Tetris titles, so the rotation patterns and colors of the Tetriminoes differ from Sega's previous releases.

Puyo Puyo Tetris was released for the Nintendo 3DS, Wii U, PlayStation Vita, PlayStation 3 on February 6, 2014 in Japan. Versions for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One were released on December 4, 2014</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2007-10-10T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords is a game developed by Australian company Infinite Interactive and published by D3 Publisher. The game combines role-playing with strategy and puzzle elements. It uses a competitive Bejeweled-style playfield to simulate combat and other activities common to role-playing games.

The game was first published simultaneously for the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable in early 2007, and several ports to other systems were subsequently announced. The Xbox Live Arcade version was released on 10 October 2007.[6] The Wii version came out on 29 November 2007. The retail version for Windows came out on 22 October 2007, although the downloadable PC version was available as of 10 October 2007. A version for PlayStation 2 was released on 13 November 2007, and was followed by a mobile version for cell phones in early 2008. It was released for PlayStation 3 on 9 October 2008 through the PlayStation Network, and for the iPhone OS through the App Store on 23 December 2008.

On 16 November 2007, at Game Connect, a conference for Australian game developers, lead designer Steve Fawkner announced that Infinite Interactive is working on a free, web-based game that will tie-in with Puzzle Quest and the developer's future titles.

In a D3 Publisher press release regarding the hiring of Adam Roberts as VP of Europe, a sequel was announced for Puzzle Quest with a 2008 release date. At the 2008 Game Developers Conference, Galactrix became publicly known as Puzzle Quest: Galactrix.</Overview>

15 years later, Rango, the 17-year-old Western Chameleon from the film, enters the scene, passed out. He wakes up and makes his way into the Gas Can Saloon. Just then Slim walks in with parts of the rock, and Rango opens it, vaporizing him. Explaining the plotline of how he first saw the rocks, he says that Bad Bill was involved. He teamed up with the Jenkins cousins in an unnatural alliance. Rango tracks down Bill at the barber shop, their hideout.

Rango blows up the barber shop, and Bill escapes, but not before Rango gets one of the rocks.</Overview>

Ratchet &amp; Clank Future: Tools of Destruction marks the beginning of a brand-new series of next-generation games for our gadget-building hero, Ratchet, and his brainy robotic sidekick, Clank.

Unfortunately for Ratchet, someone else is equally interested in Ratchet's origins: Emperor Percival Tachyon. In his thirst for revenge, the vile tyrant of an ancient race of foul insect-like monsters called Cragmites has festered an age-old grudge and is bent on wiping the last-known Lombax off the universe!</Overview>

The war between the forces of darkness and the forces of light, a conflict already many years old, has been fought to a stalemate. In the nation of Kraltarla, the forces of light hold back the evil hordes of darkness spilling from Findeste at the Scarred Mountains, but only just. In a desperate attempt to gain an advantage that could change the course of the war, the generals of the armies of light dispatch their loyal servant Sieghart, whom fate has seen fit to grant a strange and awesome power. Sieghart's mission takes him across Kraltarla to gather the components for a magical tool that can free the imprisoned blacksmith of the gods, so that he might forge magical artifacts of great and terrible power for the forces of light.</Overview>

    <Name>Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2010-10-26T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Red Dead Redemption: Undead Nightmare is an open world, western action-adventure video game developed by Rockstar San Diego and published by Rockstar Games. It was released for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles on October 26, 2010, as a downloadable expansion pack to Red Dead Redemption. The game follows John Marston as he searches for a cure for an infectious zombie plague that has swept across the American Old West.

Undead Nightmare is played from a third-person perspective in an open world environment, allowing the player to interact with the game world at their leisure. The player can travel the virtual world, a fictionalized version of the Western United States and Mexico, primarily by horseback and on foot. Hordes of zombies traverse the world, often attacking towns. Gunfights emphasize a gunslinger gameplay mechanic called "Dead Eye" that allows players to mark multiple shooting targets on enemies in slow motion. Two gameplay modes were added to Red Dead Redemption‍ '​s online multiplayer mode upon release of Undead Nightmare, allowing up to 16 players to engage in both co-operative and competitive gameplay in a recreation of the single-player setting.

Upon its release, Undead Nightmare received generally positive reviews. It won year-end accolades, including Best DLC awards from several gaming publications. A Game of the Year Edition, bundling the game with Red Dead Redemption and all additional content, was released in October 2011.</Overview>

    <Name>Red Faction: Armageddon</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-06-07T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Red Faction: Armageddon focuses on destructible environments. The player must reclaim cultist fortifications on the disaster-ravaged surface of the planet and defend colonists from hostile Martian creatures in the ancient mines and chasms beneath it and cleansing infestations from all structures.

Using the Magnet Gun, Darius, the main protagonist, fires first at one object, then at a second object, and then the first object rockets toward the second.

The Nano-Forge returns, having been passed down through two generations of the Mason family. Darius' father has incorporated the tool with a function that reverses any and all destruction dealt to man-made objects. The Nano-Forge will also feature an ability known as Impact, which discharges an incredibly powerful burst of force which can blow away structures and throw enemies off their feet.

Darius' Nano-Forge, weapons and armor are all upgradeable, improving their efficiency, unlocking new abilities, and altering their appearances.

At E3, Volition debuted the LEO exosuit, "a robotic suit with powerful weaponry whose biggest strength nonetheless appears to be its ability to crash through structures with little effort. Darius piloted the LEO at full speed through a horde of aliens, splattering them on contact, and then brought down an infested building by crashing through its walls."[5]

The game features co-operative multiplayer for up to four players, called Infestation, which features two different game modes, survival where you need to survive against waves of increasingly challenging alien attackers and defensive where you need to defend areas from attack.

In a six-part YouTube series, the game's main storyline developer Leo and Max revealed "Ruin mode". This mode consists of nothing but "blowing stuff up". Players can either take all the time they want, or cause as much destruction as possible within one minute. The latter mode will have supported worldwide and friend leaderboards.[4][6]

However, Ruin mode will only be available to players who buy the game new or purchase a code online, as players are given the choice to either play the demo of the mode or enter a code using the methods stated above.</Overview>

    <Overview>Capcom's long-running series about zombies, bioterrorism, and political machinations continues with four distinct campaigns, overhauled controls, and four-player co-op in Resident Evil 6. One campaign begins with Leon S. Kennedy and his partner Helena Harper attending an anti-bioterrorism speech by the President of the United States, only to be forced to kill him when he becomes an infected mutant. A second campaign features Chris Redfield and Piers Nivans as they head to China to battle the spread of a powerful new strain known as "C-virus."

The third campaign takes place in Eastern Europe and stars Jake Muller, son of series antagonist Albert Wesker, and Raccoon City survivor-turned government agent Sherry Birkin, as they flee from a biomechanical abomination know as an Uranak. The fourth campaign can only be unlocked once gamers finish the first three, and it stars longtime series antihero Ada Wong. All three main campaigns offer co-op support, and some sections of the game combine two groups for four-player action; while the new "Agent Hunt" multiplayer mode lets PS3 gamers become monsters and infiltrate the campaigns of fellow players.

    <ReleaseDate>2015-01-20T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The intense horror fans first experienced with the release of the original Resident Evil in 1996 is back in this HD remastering of the classic that improves on the praised 2002 "REmake". Taking place in the now notorious Raccoon City, players choose to take on the role of either S.T.A.R.S. (Special Tactics and Rescue Service) team member Chris Redfield or Jill Valentine who have been sent into the city to find the missing Bravo team. When the team is suddenly attacked by a ferocious group of mutated dogs, desperate for an escape they take shelter in the Mansion, but will they ever get out alive again? Players will need to be brave as they adventure through the dark, enclosed spaces searching out the horrors that await them. With limited ammo and survival items available gamers will need to keep their wits about them to survive the various traps and puzzles that greet them at every stage.

Enhanced for HD game platforms, resolutions and textures have been significantly upgraded, resulting in characters and backgrounds coming to life in greater detail than ever seen before in Resident Evil. Not only will the graphics impress but the tense sound effects have been fully remastered with 5.1 surround support for a greater gaming atmosphere. Players can choose between classic 4:3 ratio or a custom 16:9 widescreen mode that scrolls with the action. The classic control scheme remains for fans of the original play style or there's an alternative scheme where the character moves directly in the direction of the analogue stick.</Overview>

    <Overview>Resident Evil: Operation Raccoon City delivers a true third person team based shooter experience set within the dark and sinister Resident Evil universe. Not only does this setting provide a rich backdrop to the action but it fosters a unique and thrilling triple-threat battle scenario for the game modes. Zombies and Bio-Organic Weapons (B.O.W's) add to the mix as players compete against their team's opposing squad but also tackle this third unpredictable element that could only exist in the twisted Resident Evil universe. The result is a brand new style of gameplay that breaks the conventions of traditional third person shooters. It is September 1998 and the action focuses on the ill-fated Raccoon City and the horrific consequences of the deadly T-virus outbreak. With a cover-up required, Umbrella orders an elite team into Raccoon City to destroy all evidence of its involvement. Meanwhile the US Government has quarantined the city and dispatched its own team of elite soldiers to determine the source of the mysterious outbreak. Caught up in the action are rookie police officer Leon S. Kennedy and Claire Redfield. Players take on the role of an Umbrella Security Service (U.S.S) Soldier and battle against all the competing forces at play in Raccoon City. Choose from six characters, each one equipped with a unique skill set, including the female field scientist Four-Eyes who can manipulate the T-virus and take control of the B.O.W's raiding the streets of Raccoon City or the weapons expert and U.S.S team captain Lupo.</Overview>

    <Overview>Resonance of Fate uses what is known as the tri-Attack Battle system. The battle system is a mixture of real-time and turn-based controls. The game consists of battle elements such as command battles and action battles. Players start the battle by selecting one of the player's characters to control, following which the player takes direct control over the character. The player can then move the character around and attack targets. The character's turn ends when the player's attack is over or his action points are all used up. Enemies are also able to move while the player's character is moving and will usually attack only the character being controlled by the player. Players can restart any enemy encounter if they are defeated during battle, and for a hefty fee can replenish health or even an important resource called bezel energy. Players are also able to suspend and save the game at any time</Overview>

    <Overview>In Rise of the Argonauts, the player assumes the role of the protagonist, Jason, a Greek king. Jason's bride, Alceme, is assassinated and Jason avenges her by killing the assassin. He seals her body in the temple where they were supposed to marry, which becomes her mausoleum. After that, Jason discovers the only way to bring back his wife is to obtain the Golden Fleece, which can restore the dead. Traveling to Delphi, Jason learns from the Oracle that the only way to tread the road to the Fleece is to find three descendants of three of his patron gods: Hermes, Ares and Athena. The descendant of Hermes is found on Saria, Athena's on Kythra, whereas Ares' is located at Mycenae.

After convincing all of them to join him, Jason travels to Delphi again and learns that the Fleece is in Tartarus, the Hell of the Greek Underworld. After obtaining it, Jason sails home to revive Alceme. He confronts Pelias, his traitorous uncle. During the course of the game, Jason will face Blacktongues, who are behind Alceme's assassination, Ionians mercenaries, mythical beasts and other characters, but he won't be alone.</Overview>

    <Name>RISK: Factions</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2010-12-21T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Risk: Factions is a downloadable video game for Xbox 360's Xbox Live Arcade service (discontinued as of 2014),[2] PlayStation 3's PlayStation Network, and Windows computers through Steam. The game was announced on January 12, 2010 for Xbox 360,[3] December 21, 2010 for PlayStation 3,[4] and March 8, 2011 for Windows.[5] It is based on Hasbro's popular board game, Risk. The game has both single player and online modes of play.[6] The single player campaign is divided into 5 chapters. Each chapter unlocks one of the game's five factions. The gameplay in the single player campaign is similar to that of the 2008 Risk rule set. Players must complete three objectives and have control of their capital to win the game. Alternatively, a player may defeat all the opponents to win the game as well.

The features added to RISK: Factions that do not appear in the 2008 rule set are overkills and terrain features. Overkills are awarded when players roll either two or three sixes. If a player rolls two sixes, he destroys twice as many units as he would normally. If a player rolls three sixes, he destroys all the opponent's units in the current battle.

Some maps also have special terrain features like the volcano, which can erupt and kill most surrounding soldiers, or the temple, which allows a player who has captured it to convert another country of his choice and all units within it to his color.</Overview>

    <Overview>Players will use a guitar or drum peripheral to control the game. Two players can play what is called a "competitive co-op" throughout the entire game

Players will take on the role of the main character (voiced by Neil Patrick Harris) who has the ability to defeat enemies (often zombies) with the power of rock as he searches for his love interest, voiced by Felicia Day. Players have a few weapons at their disposal (including a shield and blast power-up), but the player can only use these by strumming the correct colored fret buttons in order on their guitar controller. The developers will have bands record rock versions of classical music.[2]</Overview>

    <Name>Rock Revolution</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2008-10-15T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Rock Revolution is a music video game developed by Zoë Mode and HB Studios and published by Konami. It was first revealed on May 15, 2008, and released on October 15, 2008 for the Nintendo DS, PlayStation 3, Wii and Xbox 360. As with similar titles, the game uses various controllers to simulate the performance of rock music, primarily using guitar and drum controllers on its Xbox 360 and PS3 versions.

Rock Revolution received generally negative reviews from critics, who felt that the game was merely an inferior clone of the Guitar Hero and Rock Band franchises with no distinguishing characteristics to set it apart from its competition; particularly the design of its drum kit controller, the game's interface, and its soundtrack of mostly cover versions as its worst aspects. The game also experienced low sales numbers in its first month, selling only around 3,000 copies.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2012-10-16T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Rocksmith is a music video game produced by Ubisoft, released in October 2011 for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 platforms in North America. Rocksmith was released on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 during September 2012 in Australian[5] and European markets[1][4] and October 2012 in Japan. A Windows version was released on October 16, 2012 after several delays. Based on the technology in the unreleased project Guitar Rising, the game's main focus is the unique feature that allows players to plug in virtually any electric guitar and play.

An expansion adding bass guitar compatibility became available on August 14, 2012. A second release which integrates the bass expansion as well as additional refinements became available on October 16, 2012.[8] Rocksmith 2014 is a 2013 sequel to the original Rocksmith, although given the series' focus it has been described as a replacement and not a sequel (as the publisher does not think it necessary to invest in the first installment in order to enjoy the second).</Overview>

    <Name>Rogue Legacy</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2013-06-27T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Rogue Legacy is a genealogical rogue-"LITE" where anyone can be a hero.

Each time you die, your child will succeed you. Every child is unique. One child might be colorblind, another might have tourettes-- they could even be a dwarf.

That's OK, because no one is perfect, and you don't have to be perfect to win this game. But you do have to be pretty darn good because this game is HARD. Fortunately, every time you die all the gold you've collected can be used to upgrade you manor, giving your next child a step up in life and another chance at vanquishing evil.

But you shouldn't listen to me. You should check out the trailer. It explains the game better then I ever could.

If you really want to READ about this game though, then you should check out our bullet list below.

    Here's what Rogue Legacy IS:
    A procedurally generated adventure. Explore new castles with every life.
    Rogue-lite. Your character dies, but with each passing your lineage grows and becomes stronger.
    Tons of unique traits that makes each playthrough special. Ever wanted to be dyslexic? Now you can!
    More than 8 classes to choose from (9)! Each class has unique abilities that change the way you play the game.
    Over 60 different enemies to test your skills against. Hope you like palette-swaps!
    Massive, expandable skill tree. Rack in the loot to upgrade your manor and give your successors a cutting edge.
    Oh yeah, there's a Blacksmith and an Enchantress shop but we forgot to show them in the trailer...
    Equip your heroes with powerful weaponry and armor. Or gain new abilities like flight, dash, and air jumping.
    Tons of secrets and easter eggs to uncover... or are there? Yes there are.
    Got a controller? Play with a controller. Big Picture ready.

    <Overview>Set during World War II, R.U.S.E. is a real-time strategy game that emphasizes gaining the upper hand through deception rather than brute force. This is accomplished by playing "ruse cards" earned during the course of battle. Among the available ruses are camouflaged troops, decoy units, radio silence, and spies that can reveal unidentified units. Up to eight players can engage in skirmishes online as one of six factions: United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Italia, France, and U.S.S.R. Each faction offers a distinct set of units and areas of strength, such as Britain's air superiority or Germany's armored vehicle prowess. A single-player campaign is included, and online games feature such customizable settings as the year of engagement (1939 to 1945), victory conditions, number of available ruses, and more.</Overview>

    <Overview>Ryū ga Gotoku Kenzan! is a spin-off of the Ryū ga Gotoku series that takes place in Kyoto in 1605. The game features mostly the same style of gameplay though its combat focus is on swordplay and not martial arts.

After being defeated by the Tokugawa clan at the historical Battle of Sekigahara, Miyamoto Musashi retires life as a swordsman to become a modest bodyguard in Kyoto. Five years later a little girl named Haruka comes to Kyoto seeking a hitman known as Kazumanosuke Kiryu which is actually Miyamoto's new identity. After eventually finding Kiryu, Haruka asks for him to assassinate an impostor pretending to be Miyamoto Musashi. At first, Kiryu refuses, but when the girl goes as far as becoming an indentured servant in an opulent brothel in order to pay for the assassination he accepts the request.</Overview>

    <Overview>Sackboy's Prehistoric Moves is a LittleBigPlanet spin-off game for two to five players that incorporates the PlayStation Move motion controller, which is required to play the game. The players take on challenges engineered by Terrance Dactyl, culminating in a battle against Evil Big Rex.

The gameplay is mostly the same platforming you have come to expect from the series, but also adds in another element - the PlayStation Move controller. The player(s) run through regular platforming environments and manipulate objects with the material that glows purple. Unlike other games in the LittleBigPlanet franchise, there are no collectible objects. Instead, the player must collect 25 secret bubbles (which leads to a gold PlayStation Network trophy).</Overview>

    <Overview>Seraphim who watched over the T Energy and therefore over the fate of the entire world. They passed their knowledge on to the High Elves, so that they could benefit from T Energy. But the High Elves let the power over T Energy tear their society apart, and war and strife broke out. Worse than that, the T Energy itself went out of control, turning negative and creating destructive evil in the land.

The nobility as well as the clerical caste of the High Elves struggled to seize power over the high-elvish imperium, so that they alone might hold the T Power in their rule. The land once more faced with war; a war that was much larger, and more far reaching consequences than all previous wars and battles. Two thousand years before Shaddar the cry for heroes arises to avert this war and to regain control over the T Energy. Will those heroes prevent the world lapsing into final chaos, or will they instead deepen it with their actions?</Overview>

    <Overview>Sacred 3 is a hack and slash brawler named as the third full game in the Sacred video game series, despite notable differences in both gameplay and design. Deep Silver, which acquired the license to Sacred 3 from former development studio Ascaron Entertainment, announced at Gamescom that the earliest it could publish the game would be in early 2012.[2] The game was finally released on August 1, 2014, among negative reviews and cold reception by the fans of the previous games in the franchise, because of the change in genre and alleged shallow gameplay.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2008-10-14T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Five years have passed since your former Saints crew betrayed you. As you awake from a coma for the first time since that fateful day, you find the Stilwater you once ruled is in disarray. Unfamiliar gangs have laid claim to your territory, rival factions have taken over your rackets, and cash-hungry corporations have laid waste to your once proud 3rd Street home. Abandoned and left scarred with an unrecognizable face, you seek out a plastic surgeon to begin your new life on the streets. Yet some things never change in Stilwater.

Respect can only be earned and that requires a lifestyle that reflects your unique personality. Your crib, your crew, and your character define who you are on the streets and how you are perceived. The image you portray is as important as the decisions you make in a city ruled by false bravado and impulsive behavior. The only constant is the need for an identity that reflects your individuality. But style and image can only take you so far in a world where actions speak louder than words. Sometimes sending a message to your enemies requires heavy lifting, like that of a rival gang member into oncoming traffic. Respect in Stilwater needs to be taken, and what better way than to grab it from the hands of a gang full of enemies by means of a satchel charge, a flame-thrower or those minigun rounds you've been saving for a special occasion.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2011-10-18T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Sam &amp; Max Beyond Time and Space, originally released as Sam &amp; Max: Season Two, is an episodic graphic adventure by Telltale Games based around the characters of the Sam &amp; Max comic series created by Steve Purcell and follows from Sam &amp; Max Save the World.

Season Two builds on Season One with more dynamic NPCs, an updated engine, a hint system, support for widescreen monitors, more realistic animations, and more mini-games within each episode. Season Two features a calibration assistant when first run, which allows the player to set their graphics and difficulty settings before playing.

Unlike Save the World, where GameTap users were able to access each episode two weeks before it was available through Telltale's website, Beyond Time and Space reduced this period down to one day.[2] The first episode, "Ice Station Santa", was released on November 8 on GameTap, followed by a worldwide release on November 9. However, the second episode was delayed until January 11, 2008. New episodes were thereafter released on the second Thursday and Friday of each month.[3]

As with Save the World in 2007, Beyond Time and Space was released on Steam on May 16, 2008.

On December 2, 2008. a press event in London, Atari announced a new partnership with Telltale to bring Sam &amp; Max Beyond Time and Space to retail worldwide in 2009. It will be for both Microsoft Windows and Wii. There will also be fully localized releases in French and German, as well as Italian and Spanish subtitles for the foreign language versions of Beyond Time and Space.[4]

On February 26, 2009, Telltale officially announced Sam &amp; Max Season One and Two for Xbox Live Arcade.[5] Telltale also officially named Season Two Beyond Time and Space.[6]

On April 18, 2009, Telltale's official Twitter page tweeted out gift codes for the downloadable version of Sam &amp; Max Season 2.</Overview>

The game was released worldwide on June 26, 2014. Shovel Knight was directed by former WayForward Technologies member Sean Velasco, and includes music composed by Jake Kaufman and Manami Matsumae.

When Shovel Knight reawakens, the Tower has been sealed and Shield Knight is nowhere to be seen. Grieving for his beloved, Shovel Knight gives up adventuring and secludes himself.

    <ReleaseDate>2010-11-09T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>SingStar: Dance, as the name suggests, is a mix between karaoke and dancing game. The karaoke part remains unchanged: player(s) sing into a microphone and the game gives points based on the performance. The only basis of assessment is if the correct note is hit with the correct timeing; the sung words or octave does not play into the result.

The dance component requires the use of the PlayStation Move controller. Then a part of the music video is concealed by a dancer who dances to the song. The player's task is to mimic those moves for points. It is possible to ignore either of the two components, because one person can't to both at once, or share the responsibilities with other players.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2009-08-04T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>SingStar games require players to sing along with music in order to score points. Players interface with their console via SingStar USB microphones while a music video plays in the background. The pitch players are required to sing is displayed as horizontal grey bars, which function similar to a musical stave, with corresponding lyrics displayed at the bottom of the screen. The game analyses a player's pitch and compares it to the original track, with players scoring points based on how accurate their singing is. Different modes of SingStar may vary this basic pattern, but the principle is similar throughout.

SingStar includes a variety of game modes. The standard singing mode allows one or two people to sing simultaneously, either competitively or in a duet.

The PlayStation 3 version of the game supports trophies, however older versions of the game will need to go online to get the latest patch. Future SingStar games will include the trophy patched game on the Singstar disc.

The game continues the same as always, the new is the list of songs inspired by the popular youth series Strawberries with Sugar. They are present the bands formed by elements of the Strawberries, and others that make only part of its soundtrack. The list of 30 songs does not meet my personal taste, but should delight the many fans of 4Taste, D'ZRT and Just Girls. It is always to praise the bet of Sony PlayStation in the national production and I am sure that there are many people who prefer to sing SingStar in Portuguese.</Overview>

    <Overview>The game begins when an electromagnetic surge from an uninhabited island called Katorga-12, once held by the Soviet Union, damages an American spy satellite. A group of American soldiers, which includes the protagonist, Captain Nathaniel Renko, goes to investigate, when another surge disables their helicopter. After they crash land on Katorga-12, Renko begins to phase between the present and 1955, the date of a catastrophic accident on the island. He arrives in 1955 in time to save a scientist named Nikolai Demichev from dying in a fire. As he rescues Demichev, a man tries to warn Renko not to save him; the man is then killed in the fire.

Back in the present, Renko discovers that Demichev has taken over the world. He is captured by Demichev's soldiers, but is rescued by Katheryn, a member of a resistance group called Mir-12. Based on a journal they found on Katorga-12, they believe that Renko can put an end to Demichev's reign using a time manipulation device called the TMD, developed by Victor Barisov. Barisov was killed by Demichev long ago, so Renko uses the TMD to save Barisov.

Back in the present, Renko and Barisov determine that they can set history right by returning to 1955 and destroying Katorga-12 with a bomb made from Element-99, the material that caused the catastrophic accident in 1955. Renko and Katheryn manage to find such a bomb, but Katheryn is lost as they retrieve it. They use the bomb to destroy the island, and thus, the research facility that Demichev used to become so powerful.

Back in the present, Renko finds Demichev holding Barisov at gunpoint. Demichev reveals that he rebuilt the facility after it was destroyed, so that history remained unchanged. Barisov realizes that it was Demichev's rescue that changed history, so he asks Renko to go back and stop his past self from saving Demichev. Demichev, in turn offers Renko a place in his empire in exchange for the TMD. He also points out that Barisov's plan has failed before – the mysterious man who told Renko not to save Demichev in 1955 was Renko himself.

At this point, the player has a choice. If Renko shoots Demichev, he goes back in time to stop himself from saving Demichev in the first place. In order to do so, he decides to kill his past self. In the epilogue, it is implied that Barisov recovered the TMD and used it to conquer the world himself. If Renko instead shoots Barisov, he and Demichev rule the world together. After some time, Demichev begins to fear Renko's growing power, and a cold war develops between the lands ruled by Renko and those ruled by Demichev. If Renko shoots both Demichev and Barisov, Renko allows the world to fall into chaos. Later, he rises up as a new world leader, using the TMD to assert his power.

A scene then shows a wounded Katheryn, pulled into 1955 by a time distortion, writing the Mir-12 journal which will later be used to track down Renko.</Overview>

    <Name>Skate</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2007-08-01T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>skate. is the first in-house developed skateboarding game by Electronic Arts, after publishing the Street Sk8er series in the past. Players can create a custom-design character and move it through the fictional town of San Vanelona. To become a top skater, players has to enter skating challenges marked on the map to gain notability, attracting sponsors and having tricks photographed or filmed. By performing well, spots can be "owned", and there are also jam sessions and death races against other skaters. Completing challenges is also rewarded with new equipment, clothing, characters and additional challenges.

There are two different paths to follow: Skateboard Mag and Trasher, both with the aim to get coverage in different magazines. The Skateboard Mag path follows a more formal career skater format, where progress through the path relies on completing photo moments, demos, contests and filming parts. The Thrasher is more of an anti-authority path, with downhill races, and screwing with security. By completing either path the player gets access to the Xgames, and the mega-ramp, which is a gigantic ramp based on a real construction.

Unlike the Tony Hawk series, movement and tricks are entirely controlled through the analog sticks.

skate.reel and the in-game replay editor allow players to go back at any time and look over there last 15-25 seconds of gameplay and view it from multiple angles. That footage can also be uploaded directly to the skate.reel website, where players vote for their favorite footage. The game supports online play with a number of challenges duplicated from the offline game as well as some unique online modes.

The game comes with a number of famous skaters, for which the appearance was licensed.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2010-05-11T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Team Up. Thrown Down. The award-winning SKATE franchise returns to break new ground with SKATE 3. Delivering the definitive co-op skateboarding experience, it's up to players to build the ultimate team and change the face of the city. Get ready to take on unique team challenges, compete against rival crews online and shred the streets of the all new skaters’ paradise, Port Carverton. Everyone can throw down in SKATE 3. New skate fans can learn the ins and outs of skateboarding with the all-new Skate.School - a place to practice and hone their skills on the sticks before hitting the streets with their team. SKATE 3 delivers all the camaraderie and competition of skateboarding. New tricks, improved off board actions, and gnarly Hall of Meat carnage mixed with exciting new team-based gameplay takes SKATE 3 to a new level of skateboarding fun.

In contrast with the original Skate, two new difficulty levels have been added: "Easy" and "Hardcore" modes. "Easy Mode" allows the player to perform tricks easier and provides greater control of the character. "Hardcore Mode" attempts a closer simulation of skateboarding and the player must perform tricks precisely. The game also features an introductory "Skate School", where Coach Frank (Jason Lee) teaches players the basics of skateboarding, such as grinding and performing ollies. This feature is optional and the area can also be visited for unrestricted skateboarding.

Similar to the Tony Hawk games, Skate features a "Skate Park" that allows players to build custom skate parks.

EA introduced three new online game modes: "1-Up", "Domination", and "Own The Lot". In "1-Up", players compete in turns to beat the other team's last score in a given time period. In "Domination", teams compete to gain the most points on set spots in an area within a time limit. In "Own The Lot", the teams compete to be the first to complete a number of specified tricks in a certain area.</Overview>

    <Name>Ski Doo: Snowmobile Challenge</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-03-06T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Ski-Doo Snowmobile Challenge is a snowmobile racing game and a follow up to the PlayStation 2 game Ski-Doo Snow X Racing. The game is similar to its predecessor but has a larger number of tracks, with 25 different events taking place in five different countries: Canada, Russia, Sweden, USA and Norway. There are four different types of events: cross country, snowcross, hill cross and freestyle. 

Like other extreme sports games doing tricks is a central part of the game. In total there are sixteen different stunts that can be done. When doing these the player's boost gauge fills up and when it's full it's possible to use adrenaline to get a boost by pushing the sled into overdrive. The player will then be able to accelerate faster, corner tighter and reach higher top speeds. Other tricks involve leaning forward to tighten the sled's turning radius or leaning backward to to gain a boost in traction and acceleration.

The game features a career mode as well as a single race mode and a multiplayer mode. In the career mode the player's aim is to become a professional snowmobile champion and along the way he will get access to new sleds and unlock special moves and new gear. This include upgrading the sled, painting it and applying various decals. The player can also unlock various outfits for the rider. In the single race mode the player can pick any rider and any course but only sleds unlocked in the career mode will be available. 

The multiplayer mode involves a split screen mode for two players. On Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 there is online multiplayer for up to twelve players.</Overview>

    <Name>Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-10-16T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure is the first video game in the Skylanders series. It is a video game that is played along with toy figures that interact with it through a "Portal of Power", that reads their tag through NFC and features the voices of Josh Keaton, Dave Wittenberg, Darin De Paul, Joey Camen, Audrey Wasilewski, Keythe Farley and Kevin Michael Richardson.

Skylanders Spyro's Adventure was published by Activision and developed by Toys for Bob. It was released on October 12, 2011 in Australia for the PC and October 13, 2011 on other consoles. The game was released in Europe on October 14, 2011, in North America on October 16, 2011, and it was released in South America (including Brazil) by Neoplay on December 15, 2011.[1][2]

Japan eventually finally saw a release of this game, being handled by Toys "R" Us and Square Enix and was released for the Wii, PlayStation 3, Nintendo 3DS and the region has also received a unique Wii U port exclusively (instead of having an Xbox 360 release), being released on July 12, 2013, which was nearly two years after its release in the western regions, thus making this the first Spyro game to be released in Japan in almost 10 years, since Spyro Orange: The Cortex Conspiracy.[3] It is also the final Japanese release of Spyro the Dragon series to be owned by Vivendi SA (Formerly Vivendi Universal).

Activision announced that as of June 3, 2012, the game had been the top selling console and handheld video game worldwide for 2012.[4][5] As of March 31, 2012, Activision has sold over 30 million Skylanders toys, and sales are expected to exceed $500 million by the end of the year.[6][7] A direct sequel, Skylanders: Giants, was released in 2012 for the Nintendo 3DS, PlayStation 3, Wii, Wii U, and Xbox 360.

As players explore the bustling and crowded Hong Kong island, through its neon-lit side streets and sprawling street markets, an incredible story unfolds of loyalty and betrayal where Wei begins to question his own motives as he is sucked in deeper than he could ever imagine.

Offering players an island packed with action, every street corner, market stall, harbor dock or city skyscraper can become an opportunity for intense shoot-outs, adrenaline-fueled street races and intense, brutal martial arts combat. Featuring one of the most intuitive and imaginative combat systems, Sleeping Dogs empowers players to perform an extensive set of martial arts moves, singlehandedly taking on numerous opponents. Players perform bone-crunching kicks and combos, vicious counters and a cinematic set of environmental takedowns making use of countless real-world items from circular saws to phone booths, incinerators to refrigerator doors.</Overview>

    <Name>Sly 2: Band of Thieves</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2010-11-09T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The sequel has a variety of changes, particularly in level design. The ultimate goal is to acquire Clockwerk parts, one or more of which can be found per "world". Sly 2 features a health meter for characters such as Sly, Bentley and Murray, replacing the "charm system" of the first game. It also takes several attacks to defeat guards. Other changes include missions where the player controls Bentley or Murray, who have their own unique skills and are able to do much more than in the previous game. However, Sly remains the main character despite these changes to character roles. Skills can be unlocked by opening safes in each world, as the previous game allowed (collecting clue bottles), but skills may also be acquired by collecting coins and purchasing them from safehouses via Thiefnet.</Overview>

    <Overview>Sly and the gang is back in this third outing of Sly Raccoon-series. This time, the story takes the boys (Sly, Bentley and Murray) to the fortress that houses the treasures of Sly's family. Although they are still weary from the adventures in the previous game, they have to get up and face the new threat that could mean the end of Sly's business and the loss of his family heritage. The game itself is a lot like the previous games: Sly sneaks, jumps, and swings himself around the levels, collecting various items, defeating bad guys and ultimately taking on the boss character. The other members of the gang step in on the action once in a while but the Sly centric sections are the main focus of the game. If you like games that had many things to do, this sneak-em-up/platform/action/adventure/puzzle game is for you.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2009-08-20T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Smash Cars is a racing game in which the player controls remote control cars. Set on a tropical island, the player has twelve courses (although some of them cover similar ground) available to race on with the twelve cars. These are categorized into three types: monster (slow and easy to handle), sport (fast and hard to handle) and the buggy which falls between.

The courses are not realistic and feature a wide variety of obstacles (slow the car down when hit), shortcuts and jumps. While using the latter, the player can initiate stunts, on PS3 optionally through move controls, and if successful (i.e. landing on the wheels) a large boost to the nitro bar is earned. Other ways to recharge nitro is to collect soda cans and crates on the way.

The PlayStation 3 version additionally includes online multiplayer for up six players. It uses the same tracks as the single-player game.</Overview>

    <Overview>Snakeball is a modern remake of the classic Snake game. The core mechanics of the game are very simple; the player controls a character riding a hoversnake and needs to pick up balls on the playfield and throw them into the hole at the center of the stage to score points before time runs out. You need to watch out for the tails of other players and the game also features different types of weapons. The playfields have bumpers and other obstacles such as mines that need to be evaded.

In singleplayer the three game modes are Snakeball (main mode), Challenge (navigate levels) and Ball Frenzy (remake of the classic gameplay). Multiplayer is supported locally through split-screen for four players and up to eight players online. The game mode for multiple players is Snakeball, with ten variations of the basic gameplay. There are 30 levels, sixteen riders to choose from, and the player can map his own face to a character using the PlayStation Eye peripheral.</Overview>

    <Overview>If sniping in real life – outside of the whole morality issue – was as easy as it is in Sniper: Ghost Warrior 2, then a few soldiers probably could save the world. Unless you’re playing on the hardest mode, bullet-drop indicators and omniscient AI teammates make sure you know exactly who to shoot and when, taking almost all the tension out of pulling the trigger. Ghost Warrior 2 ultimately does exactly what I feared the most when I started: it takes one of the highest forms of shooting skill and makes it repetitive and uninteresting.</Overview>

    <Overview>Sodium was a massively multiplayer online game that was based in and exclusive to the PlayStation 3's online community-based social gaming network PlayStation Home. Sodium was a planned four-part series of games, only two of which were released by the time of Home's closure. It was developed by Outso, a developing company that developed spaces and content for Home, and it was published by Lockwood Publishing, who had published other content for Home. The first part, Sodium One, was released on December 17, 2009 to the European and North American versions of Home.[1] It was later released in the Japanese and Asian versions on June 17, 2010 and July 29, 2010 respectively. The second part, Sodium 2: Project Velocity, was released on June 16, 2011 to the European and North American versions of Home.[2]

Due to the nature of Home, the game continued to grow and expand as Home did. New games, virtual items, and community events were continually added until November 2014 when new content ceased to be published for Home, and Home closed on March 31, 2015.[3]</Overview>

    <Overview>Sonic the Hedgehog CD (ソニック・ザ・ヘッジホッグCD Sonikku za Hejjihoggu Shī Dī?), or Sonic CD (ソニックCD Sonikku Shī Dī?), is a platform video game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega originally for the Sega/Mega-CD in 1993. It is the first game in the Sonic series to make use of the CD-ROM format, featuring high quality audio and full motion video. Development began in Japan around the same time as Sonic the Hedgehog 2 in the United States. Originally, the games had many similarities, but over time became vastly different projects.[3]

The story of Sonic CD follows Sonic the Hedgehog as he utilizes time travel to save Amy Rose and Little Planet from Doctor Eggman and Metal Sonic. The game features the debut appearances of Amy Rose and Metal Sonic, both of whom have gone on to become recurring characters in the Sonic series. Time travel is a key aspect to both the story and gameplay, with nearly every stage containing four different variations (one for each time period) featuring alternate stage layouts, music, and graphics.

Sonic CD received critical acclaim, being considered both one of the best platform and Sega/Mega-CD games of all-time.[4][5][6] It was ported to Microsoft Windows 9x as part of the Sega PC brand in 1996, and to both the PlayStation 2 and GameCube as part of the Sonic Gems Collection in 2005. An enhanced port of the game was also released for Xbox Live Arcade, PlayStation Network, iOS, Android, Windows, Windows Phone, and Ouya.</Overview>

    <Overview>The game features levels derived from 20 years of Sonic history, spreading across three eras: Classic, Dreamcast and Modern, which are played as either Classic Sonic or Modern Sonic. Classic Sonic's levels are strictly two dimensional side scrolling stages, using classic moves like the Spin Attack and Spin Dash, while Modern Sonic's levels follow the 2D/3D style gameplay of Sonic Unleashed and Sonic Colors, featuring techniques such as boosting and homing attacks. As well as classic power-ups such as Invincibility and Speed Shoes, certain levels have unique power-ups, such as skateboards in City Escape and Wisp powers in Planet Wisp.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2012-11-27T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Sonic Championship is a 3D fighting game, featuring characters from the Sonic the Hedgehog franchise. The background story is that Doctor Eggman built the Death Egg II, a new version of his facility that appeared in previous games. Stopping him requires Chaos Emeralds, and various individuals including heroes like Sonic the Hedgehog and Miles "Tails" Prower participate in a fighting tournament to gather them. In total there are eight playable characters (nine in later console releases) and two bosses (Metal Sonic and Doctor Eggman).

Gameplay is mostly typical for a versus fighter, it is a one-on-one fight on a best two out of three basis. Players use jumps, punches, kicks and special weapons. Bean the Dynamite for example, a duck-like character who makes his debut in the Sonic universe, uses bombs. Blocking is done by making use of a limited supply of barriers. The whole action is illustrated in a comical fashion though, like one would expect from a Sonic game. A round is won when a player managed to deplete an opponent's health, unless the timer runs out, in which case the character with the most energy left is the winner. Environments are 3D closed arenas, but the gameplay is mostly 2D, allowing limited sidestep maneuvers.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2013-11-19T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Mortal Kombat-style one-on-one fighting is one thing, but fighting with weapons is completely different. Soul Calibur II continues the tradition set by Soul Blade and the Dreamcast Soul Calibur with intense action and plenty of weapons to deal the massive blows.

A majority of the action takes place in Weapon Master mode, as you choose a character and travel a set map to fight the many other warriors through a collection of different terrain styles and challenges. One minute you'll be fighting in quicksand; the next you'll have to defeat an opponent by only using throwing attacks.

Other modes include the usual arcade, survival, and practice modes, and multiplayer options for two people to battle it out.

Each version of Soul Calibur II also includes a unique character for the platform. Spawn appears on Xbox, Link from The Legend of Zelda series can be found on GameCube, and Tekken fighter Heihachi finds his way to PS2.</Overview>

    <Name>Space Ace</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-02-22T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Space Ace is a laserdisc video game produced by Don Bluth Studios, Cinematronics and Advanced Microcomputer Systems (later renamed RDI Video Systems). It was unveiled in October 1983, just four months after the Dragon's Lair game, then released in Spring 1984, and like its predecessor featured film-quality animation played back from a laserdisc.

The gameplay is also similar, requiring the player to move the joystick or press the fire button at key moments in the animated sequences to govern the hero's actions. However, the game's action was more varied with the player occasionally given the temporary option to either have the character he is controlling transform back into his adult form, or remain as a boy with different styles of challenges.</Overview>

    <Name>Sports Champions</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2010-09-17T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Sports Champions is a compilation action-sports title meant to show off Sony's PlayStation Move motion controller in a similar vein to the Wii's Wii Sports. It contains a total of 6 sporting events that can be played either alone or with up to three friends. The events are:
Disc Golf - The goal of this game is to accurately throw a disc into a glowing pillar laying somewhere around the course. As the name implies this event is very similar to the game of golf, yet instead of swinging a golf club you are throwing a disc. The move controller detects everything from the angle of the disc to the power of your throw.

Gladiator Duel - In this event you go one-on-one against an opponent in an epic duel. Armed with a sword and shield your goal is to completely lower you opponents health before they do the same to you or before time runs out. Properly blocking fills up a special meter that once filled allows you to unleash a powerful combo attack. This can be played with either one or two motion controllers.

Archery - In this event you have to reach behind your back, grab an arrow, and fire away. The move controller allows you to feel like an archer and practice your accuracy skills. This can be played with either one or two motion controllers.

Beach Volleyball - In volleyball you get to control your characters actions but not it's movement. You have no saying on where your on-screen character can move, though at points you will have to do things like move the controller a certain way to make your character dive across the sand. This event is all about having perfect timing and placement with your partner in setting the ball and striking.

Bocce - In this event two players take turns throwing balls across a field trying to get it to land next to another ball. The player who lands their balls closer wins the round. Knowing tricks like twisting your arm and spinning the ball will help you to get the ball to where you want it.

Table Tennis - Table tennis is all about controlling a paddle to send a ball back and forth between players. It is like the sport of tennis except that it is played on a small table and uses paddles instead of rackets. The precision of the Move controller allows you to do moves like spins, lobs, and strikes very accurately. The goal of this game is to earn points by making your opponent miss your shots or send theirs out of bounds.
Each event contains a Champions Cup Mode. In Champions Cup Mode you must go against 10 opponents in increasing level of difficulties. Before you start the event you get to choose which character that you have unlocked to play with. There are three cups: bronze, silver, and gold, with gold being the most challenging. Having a quick time in events and not losing a lot of points allows you to earn up to three stars in each match. Having good scores allows you to gain trophies and also unlock things like new courses, clothing, items, and characters. There is also a Challenge Mode where you can play certain challenges to increase your score and a Free Play mode which you can play for fun with friends or just practice your skills.</Overview>

The new events include Skiing, Tennis, Boxing, Golf, and Bowling, offering a variety of activities that will appeal to everyone.

    <ReleaseDate>2014-05-07T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Four game developers -- Douglas Wilson, Ramiro Corbetta, Bennett Foddy, and Noah Sasso -- join forces for this compendium of four highly acclaimed local multiplayer games: Johann Sebastian Joust, BaraBariBall, Super Pole Riders, and Hokra. All four games are accessible, spectator-friendly, and deeply replayable.

Johann Sebastian Joust is a no-graphics, digitally-enabled playground game designed for motion controllers. Players try to jostle their opponents' controllers while protecting their own. How fast you can move your controller depends on the varying tempo of the music. If your controller is ever moved beyond the allowable threshold, you're out! The goal is to be the last player remaining.

BaraBariBall is a fighting/sports game for two or four players. Players score by dunking the ball in the water on the opposing team's side but lose a point for falling into the water themselves. In addition to a wide range of tactical maneuvers, players have seven air jumps, allowing for unprecedented control and ridiculously awesome aerial combat. BaraBariBall favors responsive controls, improvisation and tactics, and currently features three unique characters with a wide variety of attacks and special abilities.

Super Pole Riders is an enhanced, extended version of the hit pole-vaulting polo game, Pole Riders, bringing the highly-technical, physics-based controls of the single player game QWOP to a local multiplayer battle. Two athletic men pole-vault into the air to try to kick a ball, suspended on a rope by a pulley, into their enemy's goal. It's a no-holds-barred sport of launching yourself off your opponent's head, kicking him off his pole, and flipping the other guy into orbit with your pole.

Hokra is a minimalist digital sports game. A fast-paced, competitive game for two teams of two players each, Hokra features simple controls and minimal rules while retaining the depth that makes multiplayer games exciting for advanced players. Like the sports from which it draws inspiration, Hokra is engaging to both player and spectators.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2012-02-28T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Redefining the franchise, SSX pits riders against both mountain and man. Players explore the story of a team who seek to be the first to descend the faces of the most treacherous mountain ranges on the planet. The team travels the world to face the worst that Mother Nature can throw at them. From the peaks of the Himalayas, where the air is so thin that riders have to descend through the death zone at breakneck speeds to keep from blacking out, to the solid ice ranges of Antarctica, where a sunlit line is the only survival option when temperatures drop 50 degrees centigrade in the shade. And the mountain isn't the only danger players will face. In SSX the first goal is to survive. The second, in true SSX fashion, is to look good doing it.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2011-02-08T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Stacking is an adventure/puzzle video game developed by Double Fine Productions and published by THQ; like Double Fine's previous Costume Quest, it is a smaller title created during the development period of Brütal Legend.

The game is based on the Russian stacking matryoshka dolls, an idea coined by Double Fine's art director, Lee Petty, who saw the dolls as a means to replace the standard player interface used in graphical adventure games. The player controls the smallest doll, Charlie Blackmore, who has the ability to stack and unstack into larger dolls and use their abilities to solve puzzles to allow Charlie to free his older siblings and put an end to child labor enforced by the antagonist, the Baron. Puzzles within the game have multiple solutions, and include additional puzzles and challenges that allow the player to explore the game's world outside of the main story.</Overview>

Edge Maverick and his childhood friend Reimi Saionji are chosen as pioneer members of the Space Reconnaissance Force, which was created to seek out new worlds beyond the stars. Their ship, the Calnus, takes its place on the lunar launch pad along with four other starships of the first reconnaissance fleet. These ships - humanity’s last hope - blast off one-by-one and sail into the awaiting wormhole that leads to the vast star ocean.

    <Name>Star Trek</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2013-04-23T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Star Trek is a cooperative action game based on the movie reboot of the franchise in 2009, and released as a tie-in with the second film Star Trek Into Darkness. Based on the same canon, the game's events are set between the two films. Players can play as one of two characters, Captain James T. Kirk, or his second in command, Commander Spock. The whole game is co-op, with an AI player or friend playing whichever character you do not play as. Playing alone characters can only be switched between chapters and not during gameplay. With another player, a drop-in mechanic is supported. The antagonist of the game is the Gorn, an evil reptilian race, who attack a New Vulcan colony through a rip in space. 

The game revolves around a cooperative mindset, with players playing off each others different skill sets. Each character has a distinct set of abilities, with Captain Kirk being a more typical shooter, armed with a phaser with a stun setting, and Commander Spock, a more stealth based character armed with a couple of abilities as well as a gun with a freeze setting. As the player plays through the game, they gain experience by scanning objects, hacking and discovering audio logs. Experience is used to unlock additional abilities for their respective weapons. The tricorder offers many shooting options and the characters have the ability to rewire turrets and hack flying drones. The two characters can help each other out by boosting shields and weapons.

Next to the corridor-based shooting gameplay, there is a space battle with turrets and many platforming sections. Certain stages are set in space, where characters need to dodge debris and a single level contains underwater sections.</Overview>

    <Name>Star Wars: The Force Unleashed</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2008-09-16T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is a LucasArts action-adventure video game and part of the The Force Unleashed project. It was initially developed for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360 consoles and on the iOS, second-generation N-Gage, Nintendo DS, PlayStation Portable, and Java-equipped mobile phone handhelds.[1]

The game was released in North America on September 16, 2008, in Australia and Southeast Asia on September 17, and in Europe on September 19. LucasArts released downloadable content for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles.[2] An Ultimate Sith Edition of the game, containing new and all previously released expanded content, was released in November 2009,[3] which also came out on Mac OS and Microsoft Windows.

The project bridges the first two Star Wars trilogies, acting as an origin story for both the united Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Civil War depicted in the Original Trilogy. The game introduces a new protagonist, "Starkiller", as Darth Vader's secret apprentice, who is tasked with hunting down Jedi while killing rebels and Imperials alike in order to hide his existence from the Emperor, but soon starts to slowly redeem himself to the light side of the Force.

Reviews offered fairly positive response, praising The Force Unleashed for its compelling story, robust physics, impressive art and soundtrack, while some more negative reviews cited frustrating gameplay. Despite this, the game was a bestseller in the United States and Australia, with over one million copies sold its debut month. As of February 2010, the game has sold over seven million copies, and it is the fastest-selling Star Wars video game.[4] A sequel, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II, was released in October 2010.[5]</Overview>

    <Name>Super Mega Baseball</Name>
    <Overview>Tight controls and a smooth learning curve will have you knocking it out of the park in no time in this awesome arcade baseball simulator. Polygon’s 2014 Sports Game of the Year.
Features:
Realistic Simulation and Physics: Don’t be fooled by the light-hearted/comical presentation; the fundamentals of baseball are well represented and if someone isn’t familiar with the rules, they will be after playing Super Mega Baseball.
Groundbreaking Difficulty System: Super Mega Baseball boasts an innovative difficulty control scheme called the Ego system. The Ego system offers a fine-grained control of difficulty on a per-user basis, which has been widely praised for leveling the playing field in cooperative and competitive modes. This system will push seasoned gamers to their limits while simultaneously providing a gentle introduction for beginners.
Up-to Four Player Local Co-op Play: In addition to solo play, players can try their hand at head-to-head, 2v1, 2v2 and co-op against the CPU. In co-op mode, teammates alternate batting/running each time at-bat, and alternate pitching/fielding each inning, meaning ballplayers need to be on their toes every play. To even games, players can use the Ego system to set up a competitive game between friends of any skill level.
Ultra Responsive and Blazing Fast Gameplay: Controls are easy to learn, but players will need to master jumping, diving, wall-catches, power-swings and cut-off plays to properly dominate friends. Short load times and a streamlined interface means most of the time is spent in the action, with nine-inning games taking around 20 minutes to play.
Full Batting and Pitching Statistics: Most baseball statistics imaginable are available and ballplayers can use these to show off their MVP-quality skills.
Leveling System: Players tally up Starpoints for hits, strikeouts and catches during each game and Level Up once they collect enough points. Players can hire staff to train and coach their squad, improving skill attributes such as Power and Speed. Use that jacked up team to win at higher difficulties (and post higher leaderboard scores than friends)!
Player Customization: Customize the look and names of a team’s players to create a ragtag crew of family and friends. Make as many aesthetic adjustments as you can imagine!</Overview>

    <Name>Swarm</Name>
    <Overview>Swarm is a platform game where the player controls 50 small blue creatures, called swarmites. With these swarmites, the player has to collect DNA to safe their race. When the player controls the swarmites, all 50 are controlled at the same this. Every swarmite does have its own AI, which causes the interaction to be a lot more dynamic. For example, walking around an object may cause several swarmites to walk around the other side of the object than the other part.

The title is marked by its dark humor, since the game has a lot of ways the swarmites can die, from falling to their deaths to burning alive. To complete a mission successfully, at least one swarmite must be alive at the end of the level. The game does support checkpoints from which the player can restart when all swarmites are dead.

To unlock further levels, a minimum set of points must be obtained. These points are obtained by collecting the DNA. Most of the time these DNA can only be obtained when several swarmites are alive. So it's best to keep as many swarmites alive as possible.</Overview>

SYBERIA -- A journey beyond compare... For the young Kate Walker, an ambitious lawyer, the Voralberg toy company acquisition seemed like a textbook case -- a quick stopover to a small alpine village in France to buy-out an old automaton factory, then straight back home to New York. Her journey across land and time throws all she values into question, while the deal she set out to sign turns into a pact with destiny...

SYBERIA II -- Embarking on a desperate search for Hans Voralberg, Kate Walker crosses Europe from West to East. She has left behind all her worldly possessions with the express purpose of joining the heir of the Voralberg family on his journey. Together, through mystical and enchanting lands, they will find their way to the mythical Syberia, land of the forgotten mammoths. Make your way to Syberia, overcome many difficult obstacles on the way, and deal with shady characters to uncover clues vital to the continuation of the quest. The game features four different worlds to explore and an updated graphics engine with dynamic lighting effects.</Overview>

    <Name>Tales of Monkey Island</Name>
    <Overview>Tales of Monkey Island is a 2009 graphic adventure video game developed by Telltale Games and LucasArts. It is the fifth game in the Monkey Island series, released nearly a decade after the previous installment, Escape from Monkey Island. Developed for Windows and the Wii console, the game was released in five episodic segments, between July and December 2009. In contrast to Telltale's previous episodic adventure games, whose chapters told discrete stories, each chapter of Tales of Monkey Island is part of an ongoing narrative. The game was digitally distributed through WiiWare and Telltale's own website, and later through Steam and Amazon.com. Ports for OS X, the PlayStation Network, and iOS were released several months after the series ended.

Players assume the role of pirate Guybrush Threepwood, who—while attempting to destroy his nemesis, the undead pirate LeChuck—accidentally releases a voodoo pox across the Gulf of Melange. With the assistance of his wife, Elaine Marley–Threepwood, Guybrush seeks out a cure. The game was conceived in late 2008, due to renewed interest in adventure game development within LucasArts. It was developed concurrently with LucasArts' special edition of the 1990 title The Secret of Monkey Island; LucasArts oversaw production of Tales of Monkey Island, and ensured that it matched the remake in certain areas, such as art direction. Production began in early 2009; franchise creator Ron Gilbert was involved in project planning, while development was led by Dave Grossman, who co-designed the first two Monkey Island games. The game's music was composed by Michael Land, and the core cast of The Curse of Monkey Island reprised their voice roles.

Tales of Monkey Island received generally positive reviews. Critics praised the game's story, writing, humor, voice acting and characterization; 1UP.com described Guybrush as Telltale's strongest and most expressive character yet. The game's music and graphics were also lauded. Complaints focused primarily on the perceived erratic quality of the game's puzzle design, a weak supporting cast in the early chapters, and the game's control system. Tales of Monkey Island garnered several industry awards, and was Telltale's most commercially successful project until Back to the Future: The Game.</Overview>

    <Overview>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows is a 2013 downloadable video game developed by Red Fly Studio[1] and published by Activision based on the ongoing Nickelodeon animated television series of the same name and the tone has a similar tone to the 2003 animated television series of the same name too. The game was released on August 28, 2013 for Xbox Live Arcade and Steam.[1] The game features a four-player online mode and offline two-player co-op.[3][4]

As of September 2013, the Online Co-op for the Steam version is suffering from major technical difficulties.[5] The PlayStation Network version was delayed, the reason being was to polish the game more before release and to likely address issues from the Xbox 360 and PC versions of the game. On April 1, 2014, It was announced by Red Fly Studio that the PSN version would be released on April 15 on the PSN store. The PSN release featured a very identical version of the game, with hardly any of the aforementioned issues addressed, despite Red fly Studio's promise to present an experience polished to the highest of levels.</Overview>

    <Overview>Tekken 6 features bigger stages with more interactivity than its predecessors, such as walls or floors that can be broken to reveal new fighting areas. The character customization feature has been enhanced, and certain items have implications in some aspects of gameplay.
A new "rage" system has been added, giving characters more damage per hit when their vitality is below a certain point. Once activated, a reddish energy aura appears around the character, and their health bar starts to flicker in red. The rage aura can be customized with different colors and effects to appear like fire, electricity, ice, among others. Another gameplay feature added is the "bound" system. Every character has several moves that, when used on an opponent that is currently midair in a juggle combo, will cause the opponent to be smashed hard into the ground, bouncing them off the floor in a stunned state and leaving them vulnerable to another combo or additional attack. As of the Bloodline Rebellion update, successfully parrying a low attack will also put a character into a bound state.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2015-03-17T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Tennis in the Face in not an actual game of tennis, but the player gets to use the racket and tennis balls to hit all the targets in the room. There are no scrolling screens, each level is a single-scree area where the player has to hit all enemies on the screen which may include clowns, riot police and more. Each ball bounces off of solid walls and disappears after certain number of bounces or traveling length. Not all targets can be hit in a straight line, and some may even require you to use the environment to your advantage, such as breakable glass, explosive crates, and other objects of interest. Each level score is rated in the number of balls you've spent in order to complete the level. When you lose all the balls without taking down all your opponents, the level forces you to retry. You can leave it for later, though, and tackle any other level on the world map that is adjacent to any of your cleared area. After beating all the matches on the map area, new area will get unlocked with different type of opponents and interactive objects. Tennis in the Face is almost identical to Baseball Riot game with focus on a different sport.</Overview>

    <Name>The Beatles: Rock Band</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-09-08T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The Beatles: Rock Band is a 2009 music video game developed by Harmonix, published by MTV Games, and distributed by Electronic Arts. It is the third major console release in the Rock Band music video game series, in which players can simulate the playing of rock music by using controllers shaped like musical instruments. The Beatles: Rock Band is the first band-centric game in the series, and it is centered on the popular English rock group the Beatles. The game features virtual portrayals of the four band members performing the songs throughout the band's history, including depictions of some of their famous live performances, as well as a number of "dreamscape" sequences for songs from the Abbey Road Studios recording sessions during the group's studio years. The game's soundtrack consists of 45 Beatles songs; additional songs and albums by the Beatles were made available for the game as downloadable content.[1]

The game was released internationally on 9 September 2009, coinciding with the release of new, remastered compact disc versions of the Beatles' albums. It incorporates many of the gameplay features of the Rock Band series; however, it is not an expansion pack for the Rock Band series and content for it and other Rock Band titles is not cross-compatible. Harmonix co-founder Alex Rigopulos described the game as "... a new, full game title production built from the ground up."[2] Gameplay mechanics differ slightly from previous Rock Band games, including the addition of a three-part vocal harmony system. Subsequent games in the Rock Band series would reuse these new elements, including vocal harmonies.

The game was developed with the blessing and critical input of Apple Corps, including former Beatles Sir Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr, who both made public appearances supporting the game. George Harrison's son Dhani helped to bridge discussion between Harmonix and Apple Corps, while Giles Martin, son of the Beatles' music producer George Martin, ensured high-fidelity versions of the Beatles' songs would be available.

The Beatles: Rock Band was well received by the press, both as a genuine means of experiencing the music and history of the Beatles and as a standalone music video game. Although the game's sales were considered respectable, with more than half a million units sold during its first month of release in the United States, analysts had projected larger sales volumes and attributed the lower sales to waning interest in the rhythm game genre and the video game industry recovery from the late-2000s recession</Overview>

    <Name>The Bureau: XCOM Declassified</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2013-08-20T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The battle of humans against an invading alien force erupts in The Bureau: XCOM Declassified, a new story and unique gameplay experience set inside one of gaming's most storied and beloved franchises. Set in 1962 at the height of the Cold War, The Bureau tells the origin story of the clandestine XCOM organization's first encounter with a mysterious and devastating enemy. Originally established as America's covert defense against the Soviet Union, The Bureau must adapt and overcome a threat unlike anything the world has faced before. As special agent William Carter, players will call the shots and pull the trigger, leading their squad of agents in the high-stakes secret war for humanity’s survival. Paramount to repelling the outside threat is The Bureau’s ability to cover-up the enemy’s existence in order to prevent worldwide panic.

In the spirit of the XCOM franchise, The Bureau's calculated combat design requires players to think and act tactically. The game's third-person perspective gives the player a sense of spatial awareness and grants them the freedom to transition in and out Carter's unique Battle Focus ability seamlessly -- heightening the tactical shooter action. The Bureau also fully embraces the concept of permanent consequence. As our last line of defense, every command can mean the difference between life and death for Carter, his squad and mankind.</Overview>

    <Name>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion: Game of the Year Edition</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2007-10-16T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is an action role-playing video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios and published by Bethesda Softworks and the Take-Two Interactive subsidiary, 2K Games. It is the fourth installment in The Elder Scrolls action fantasy video game series, following The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind and preceding The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Oblivion was first released in March 2006 for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360. A mobile phone version of the game was released in May 2006, and a PlayStation 3 version was shipped in March 2007. After a number of smaller content releases, a major expansion pack, Shivering Isles, was distributed. The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Game of the Year Edition (a package including both Shivering Isles and the official expansion pack Knights of the Nine) was released in 2007 for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, and PlayStation 3. A fifth-anniversary edition was shipped in 2011.

Oblivion '​s main story revolves around the player character's efforts to thwart a fanatical cult known as the "Mythic Dawn" that plans to open the gates to a realm called "Oblivion". The game continues the open world tradition of its predecessors by allowing the player to travel anywhere in the game world at any time and to ignore or postpone the main storyline indefinitely. A perpetual objective for players is to improve their character's skills, which are numerical representations of certain abilities. Seven skills are selected early in the game as major skills, with the remainder termed minor. Developers opted for tighter pacing in gameplay and greater plot focus than in past titles.

Development for Oblivion began in 2002, directly after the release of Morrowind. To design the graphics, Bethesda used an improved Havok physics engine, high dynamic range lighting, procedural content generation tools that allowed developers to quickly create detailed terrains, and the Radiant A.I. system, which enabled non-player characters (NPCs) to make choices and engage in behaviors more complex than in past titles. The game features fully voiced NPCs—a first for the series—and the music of award-winning composer Jeremy Soule. Overall, Oblivion was well received by critics, and has won a number of industry and publication awards. It was praised for its impressive graphics, expansive game world and schedule-driven NPCs. Within a month, the game had shipped over 1.7 million copies, and by November 2011, sold over 3.5 million. Electronic Entertainment Design and Research, a market research firm, estimates that the game has sold 9.5 million copies worldwide.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2007-10-24T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Sony Computer Entertainment introduces a new concept in trading card games with THE EYE OF JUDGMENT™ developed exclusively for PLAYSTATION®3 computer entertainment system. Utilizing Hasbro® and its Wizards of the Coast subsidiary's trading card expertise, the immense power of the PS3® system, and the PLAYSTATION®Eye, Sony's groundbreaking next-generation USB camera for PS3, THE EYE OF JUDGMENT provides a visually stunning experience that adds a third dimension to the trading card game genre.
Developed by Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide Studios, JAPAN Studio, THE EYE OF JUDGMENT presents a new style of gameplay where collectable trading cards, embedded with a CyberCode, are brought to life in the 3D game through use of the innovative PLAYSTATION Eye. Players compete by selecting a card and placing the coded card in front of the PLAYSTATION Eye for their respective creatures to come to life and battle on screen. Players take turns placing cards as they jostle for control; the winner is the first player to conquer five of the nine squares of the "9 Fields" battle mat. The gamers task is to conquer the board by deploying their cards more skillfully than their opponent.
Players have four ways to play THE EYE OF JUDGMENT, single player against their PS3, against an opponent in two-player mode, against an opponent online, or letting the PS3 play out a round with the cards the player owns. THE EYE OF JUDGMENT comes with a starter deck of 30 character and spell cards manufactured by Hasbro.</Overview>

    <Name>The Godfather II</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-04-07T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The Godfather II game goes beyond the film's story by setting players in the world of organized crime in 1960’s Florida, Cuba and New York.

After being promoted by Michael Corleone to Don of New York, players expand to new cities, as they build up their families through extorting businesses, monopolizing illegal crime rings and defeating new families in an effort to become the most powerful mob family in America. To help players manage their empire, The Godfather II introduces "The Don's View" -- an innovative strategy meta-game that allows players to oversee the entire world as they grow the family business. Using the Don's View, players will be able to build, defend and expand their crime rings, while keeping an eye on the movements and plans of the rival families. Players will also learn to master the business of organized crime by building a family of Made Men, hiring crew, handing out orders, and promoting their best men up the ranks.</Overview>

    <Name>The Golden Compass</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2007-12-04T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The game is played from a third-person perspective with players controlling either Lyra Belacqua and her dæmon Pan, or the Panserbjørne Iorek Byrnison. Lyra's levels primarily involve platforming, stealth and puzzle solving,[3] whilst Iorek's are mainly melee combat based.[4]

A major aspect of the gameplay of Lyra's levels involves the shape-shifting ability of Pan, who has access to four forms; Ermine, Sloth, Hawk and Wildcat, each with its own unique ability. The Ermine's ability is "Insight", which allows Lyra to discover information about her surroundings, find hotspots, and unveil secrets. The Sloth's ability is "Whip", which allows Lyra to swing from poles and reach areas she cannot simply jump to. The Hawk's ability is "Glide", which allows Lyra to glide a short distance, covering gaps she wouldn't be able to any other way. The Wildcat's ability is "Climb", which allows Lyra to climb certain surfaces to reach otherwise inaccessible areas. Players often have to shift form mid-move. For example, to reach a certain platform, Lyra may need to use the "Whip" ability to swing on a pole, and after releasing herself from the pole may need to immediately use the "Glide" ability to reach the platform.[5][6][7]

Also important in Lyra's levels are Evasion and Deception minigames. Evasion games occur whenever Lyra is spotted by an enemy and involves button presses to correspond with icons on screen to allow Lyra escape from her pursuer. Deception games are more common and occur regularly throughout her levels. These games take place whenever Lyra is involved in a conversation with someone and is attempting to deceive them. The better the player performs in the minigame, the more successful Lyra is in her deception. The minigames include, but are not limited to, matching symbols, collecting falling icons, avoiding falling icons, a Whac-A-Mole type game and a snooker type game.

Another major aspect of the gameplay is the Alethiometer. Once the player has access to the Alethiometer, it can be asked certain set questions. The device has thirty-six symbols on its outer edge, each with three meanings. These meanings are discovered over the course of game; some are learned automatically, some must be sought out by the player. For each question, Lyra is given three words, and each word is assigned a hand on the Alethiometer. If Lyra knows the corresponding symbol of a given word, the handle automatically turns to the correct symbol. Words she doesn't know must be guessed by the player. When the three hands are all pointing at symbols, the player confirms the selection and Lyra asks the question. A balancing minigame then begins, where the player must press buttons corresponding to the on-screen display. The more symbols which were correctly identified in the first part of the game, the easier the balancing game is.</Overview>

    <Name>The King of Fighters XII</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-07-24T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The legendary 3-on-3 fighting game series that united rival brawlers from SNK PLAYMORE's classic arcade franchises celebrates its 15th anniversary in style with the 2009 release of The King Of Fighters XII. For the first time in its history, this epic martial arts showdown has undergone a complete graphical overhaul. The antiquated character sprites used over the past 14 years have been dropped in favor of all-new, high-resolution fighters fluidly animating across painstakingly detailed, 100% hand-drawn backgrounds. 

The King of Fighters XII is a pure arcade fighting title. Like a few other releases in its franchise it does not contain a storyline, instead focusing on the tried and true 3-on-3, five round team fighting gameplay mechanic. Far from a liability, the lack of storyline plays into the fighting mechanic by eliminating official teams linked to the prevailing story, which in earlier releases compromised the characters that could be added to a team. In addition, the game also features new combat elements including the "Critical Counter" system which opens up the possibility of additional linked attacks and finishing moves when players land effective counter punches following an opponent's attack, and "Clash Timing," a break effect during a bout that separates combatants when they land blows on each other at the exact same time.</Overview>

    <Name>The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2010-09-14T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest is a 2010 action-adventure video game developed by Headstrong Games for Wii, and TT Fusion for Nintendo DS, PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Portable. It was published on all platforms by WB Games.

The game is an adaptation of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings film trilogy; The Fellowship of the Ring (2001), The Two Towers (2002) and The Return of the King (2003). Set fifteen years after the War of the Ring, the game features Samwise Gamgee telling his children of the adventures of Aragorn during the conflict; his stories form the majority of the game's content. Aragorn's Quest was the first Lord of the Rings game released by WB Games, who had acquired the rights to make games based on the New Line Cinema film series from Electronic Arts in 2009.

The game was aimed primarily at younger players, offering a simplified and less violent version of the plots of the three films. It received mixed to negative reviews, with critics finding the combat repetitive, the narrative too truncated and the overall game too easy.</Overview>

    <Name>The Lord of the Rings: Conquest</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-01-13T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The Lord of the Rings: Conquest is an action game developed by Pandemic Studios and published by Electronic Arts. It is derived from the The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, and borrows many gameplay mechanics from Pandemic's Star Wars: Battlefront games. The game allows the player to play as both the forces of good and evil, but unlike The Lord of the Rings: The Battle for Middle-earth, the latter option is based around Sauron stopping the One Ring from being destroyed and using it to regain his lost power.[2] On December 23, 2008, the PlayStation 3 demo was made available on the PlayStation Network[5] while the Xbox 360 demo was released January 2, 2009.[6]

Pandemic was aided by Weta Digital in developing the game. They provided many of their digital models, including the fell beasts. Pandemic also used elements that were cut from the films, and have taken inspiration from J. R. R. Tolkien's original fantasy novel, such as a level based loosely around Balin's conquest of Moria, in which Gimli attempts to retake the dwarven city from the orcs. Some inspiration was less direct: the armies of Rohan and Gondor decide not to attack Minas Morgul in the novel, but a level in the game is based on what might possibly have happened if they had. The game uses Howard Shore's score to the films as its soundtrack.[2]

On March 16, 2010, the online multiplayer modes of The Lord of the Rings: Conquest were shut down for PC, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.[7] On August 16, 2010 a group of fans launched the non-profit CNQReboot servers, allowing users of the PC version to play online using tunnelling software that allows network play via the local area network option.[8]</Overview>

    <Name>The Lord of the Rings: The War in the North</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-11-01T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The Lord of the Rings: War in the North is a 2011 action role playing hack and slash video game developed by Snowblind Studios and published by Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360 and Microsoft Windows. An OS X port was developed and published by Feral Interactive in 2013. It is the first video game based on both J. R. R. Tolkien's 1954 high fantasy novel The Lord of the Rings and Peter Jackson's film trilogy adaptation released in 2001 (The Fellowship of the Ring), 2002 (The Two Towers) and 2003 (The Return of the King). This is because, until 2009, Vivendi Universal Games, in partnership with Tolkien Enterprises, held the rights to make games based on Tolkien's literary works, whilst Electronic Arts held the rights to make games based on the New Line Cinema films. In 2009, WB Games acquired the rights for both intellectual properties.

The game contains narrative elements unique to both the novel and the films, although the aesthetic design is based more specifically upon the look of the films, with characters in the game bearing the likenesses of the actors who portrayed them in the films. The game does not directly adapt the story depicted in the novel and films, but instead depicts a trio of adventurers whose quest runs parallel to the main narrative, occasionally intersecting with it. The story follows them as they attempt to track down and defeat a powerful Black Númenórean named Agandaûr, who Sauron has employed to lay waste to the northern regions of Middle-earth, whilst Sauron himself concentrates on Rohan and Gondor.

The game received mixed reviews, with critics praising the graphics and tone, but criticizing the repetitive combat, weak storyline and poor character development. It was also criticized for containing several game-breaking bugs. War in the North was a commercial failure, a fact many critics attributed to the timing of its release - several weeks after Dark Souls, on the same day as Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception and ten days prior to The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.</Overview>

    <Name>The Revenge of Shinobi</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2012-05-22T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The game is a traditional side-scrolling platform game. The player controls Joe Musashi and must complete eight districts before the final confrontation with the head of Neo Zeed. Each district consists of three scenes, two of which are platforming levels and the third being a battle against a unique boss-character.
The D-pad moves Musashi around while the A, B and C buttons are used to perform a ninjitsu technique, attack and jump respectively. A key move in The Revenge of Shinobi is the somersault, which maximizes Musashi's jumping height and enables him to throw eight shuriken at once in mid-air. Additionally, some stages consist of multiple layers, such as the first scene of the Military Base and the freeway in Area Code 818. Switching between layer (outdoor/indoor, or on-the-highway/next-to-it) is also done with the somersault move.</Overview>

    <Overview>The player is able to explore Nazi-occupied Paris, some of the French countryside and parts of Germany.[3] Color is a key element in the gameplay. Areas which are heavily controlled by the Nazis are represented in black and white, with the exception of the irises of characters' eyes, city lights, blue symbols of the French Resistance, and various German symbols, which are bright red and complete with swastikas. In order to make that district colored ("inspired") again, players must weaken the German forces occupying the area. In doing so, that district's citizens regain their hope, visually represented by making the area vibrant and full of color. This also affects gameplay; in black and white areas, German soldiers are present in large numbers, making it far more likely that Sean will be detected in his rebellious activities.</Overview>

    <Name>The Simpsons Arcade Game</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2012-02-07T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Waylon Smithers has just stolen a diamond from Springfield Jewelers for Mr. Burns. While trying to make a getaway, he crashes into Homer, which knocks the diamond out of his hand. Maggie catches it in her mouth, prompting Smithers to grab her and run off. The Simpsons decide to go after him, but Mr. Burns has tons of henchmen, who want to prevent the family getting their daughter back.

The Simpsons is basically a side-scrolling beat-em-up featuring the characters from The Simpsons TV show. The player can choose to play as each of the four Simpson characters. Homer, who punches and kicks; Marge, who swings her vacuum cleaner; Bart, who wields his skateboard; and Lisa, who uses a jump rope as a whip. Other weapons such as hammers and bowling balls are also available to use. The game's levels are Downtown Springfield, Krustyland, Springfield Discount Cemetery, Moe's Tavern, Springfield Gorge, Dreamland, the Channel 6 studio, and the Power Plant. Each level ends with a boss whose speed and strength will increase after taking a certain amount of damage. End level bosses are the wrestler Professor Werner von Brawn, a hot air balloon shaped like Krusty the Clown, a pair of bouncers, a drunk at Moe's Tavern, a henchman in a bear suit, an imaginary, gigantic bowling ball, and a martial arts sensei dressed like a kabuki actor. There's also the showdown finale against Smithers and Mr. Burns in a robotic outfit.

Between levels, the player can compete against the other characters in two mini-games to be first to complete a task (inflating a balloon and waking up their character).</Overview>

    <Name>Thomas Was Alone</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2013-04-23T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Thomas Was Alone is a puzzle platformer about friendship and a remake of the Flash game with the same name. The player takes control of a red shape that represents a string in a programming environment. The goal is to move through an abstract environment to complete 100 levels by moving and jumping. A level is completed when the shape is moved to a white outline of its form.

While the environment is a plain collection of shapes and the puzzle platforming is straightforward, the game is brought to life through the narration, explaining the thoughts and the emotions of the shape. The red shape is called Thomas and he feels alone. He has no idea where he is and does not know his purpose, but he quite enjoys moving around and jumping. Soon after, other shapes appear and while they provide a method for more complex puzzles by working together, the story's focus is on the interaction between the shapes, building their personality through their cooperation and abilities. The first to appear next is Christopher, an orange cube who takes an immediate dislike to Thomas. He cannot jump as high and they often need to act as stepping stones for each other. Other shapes to appear are the long and high jumping John, the large cube Claire who feels like a superhero because she can float on water while other shapes drown when they come in contact with it, and Laura who can be used to bounce as a trampoline.

In levels with multiple shapes, the player can switch between them to control them individually. Those levels have multiple white outlines and they can only be completed when all shapes are in the correct place. Not all levels contain all shapes at once but the player has no control over this at the start of a level. A grumpy Chris will for instance go about alone, and often the choice of the participating shapes and the level/puzzle design complement each other to visually express their emotions. In the level where Chris starts to fall in love with Laura for instance, the level is designed with a low ceiling showing Chris jumping like mad on Laura's trampoline shape. Later on a nemesis is introduced as a floating cloud.

A DLC expansion called Benjamin's Flight was first introduced as a commercial add-on for the PlayStation versions. Later it was made available for free for platforms were the game was already released (PC) and new platform versions had it included by default (iOS, Android, Wii U and Xbox One).</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2007-11-19T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>In the nearby future scientists develop a so-called Quantum suit that allows the carrier to travel through time. Two prototypes called Alpha and Betasuit are ready for testing when Aiden Krone enters the lab, steals the Alphasuit and makes a time-jump before he blows up the building. Luckily you were there and had the chance to jump into the Betasuit and activate the time travel before the building was destroyed. But it took the suit a second too long to jump so the explosion hit it and your jump didn't go as planned. When you wake up in an alley in the future you quickly realize that Krone has already declared himself leader of the world and transformed it into a totalitarian state with him as the dictator. Shortly after waking up, you are found by some rebels and you join their task in order to stop Krone and fix the timeline since your suit was too badly damaged by the blast.

Fight your way through hordes of enemies with futuristic, but also conventional weapons like pistols or shotguns. Your suit isn't rendered totally useless. It still allows you to slow down, rewind and forward time for a short period. This not only allows you to overcome obstacles like fire but you can also trick your enemies. Players can slow down the time and then steal the weapon out of the hand of an enemy - if he hasn't a too strong grip on it. This feature is also used for small time-related puzzles. 

There are notable differences with the time manipulation element from the Prince of Persia series. Manipulating the time won't affect yourself and when you are too badly wounded and die, you can't just rewind. You remain dead and have to reload. The game also doesn't feature medipacks. Instead the hero just needs to rest for a second if he is wounded and will then be fully healed again.

Manipulating time is also part of the multiplayer-experience. Besides the normal game-modes Deathmatch, Team-Deathmatch, One-on-One and Capture the flag, the game also features King of Time and Meltdown Madness.

In King of Time there's a Time Sphere in the center of the map which makes you impervious to all time effects. To win the game you need to rack up kills while you have the item. Meltdown Madness instead requires of you to throw Chrono Grenades at the opposing team's machine to prevent it from functioning. Once a machine of a team has completed his countdown, that team wins.

The Chrono Grenades are also part of all the other game modes in addition to the Time Shield and the Time Resistance power-up. While the Chrono Grenades come in the three flavors and slow down, forward or rewind time in the area of the blast. The Time Shield not only makes you immune to time manipulation but also slows down every foreign object in a specific area which is good for dodging enemy fire. The Time Resistance power-up grants immunity against all time effects for a short period of time.</Overview>

    <Overview>ToeJam &amp; Earl is an action video game developed by Johnson Voorsanger Productions and published by Sega for the Mega Drive video game console. Released in 1991, it centers on the titular ToeJam and Earl—alien rappers who have crash-landed on Earth. As they attempt to escape the planet, players assume the role of either character and collect pieces of their wrecked spacecraft. ToeJam &amp; Earl's design was heavily influenced by the role-playing video game Rogue, and took from it such features as the random generation of levels and items.</Overview>

    <Name>ToeJam &amp; Earl in Panic on Funkotron</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2012-11-06T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>ToeJam &amp; Earl in Panic on Funkotron is a platform video game, developed by Johnson Voorsanger Productions and published by Sega in 1993 for the Mega Drive. The game is the sequel to cult video game ToeJam &amp; Earl, released in 1991. The game concerns two alien protagonists, ToeJam and Earl, both of whom have escaped from Earth, where they had crash landed. After returning to their home planet of Funkotron, the duo discover a number of antagonistic Earthlings have stowed away on the spacecraft and are wreaking havoc across the planet. The player must hunt down these Earthlings and imprison them in jars before sending them back to Earth.

The game's platform format was a departure from the original ToeJam &amp; Earl, a treasure hunt game with randomly generated levels, inspired by the game Rogue. Creators Greg Johnson and Mark Voorsanger originally began designing a game built on the concepts of the original, but changed to a more generic type of game due to a lack of support for their vision on the part of Sega. The game was critically well received, with reviewers praising the graphics, soundtrack, fluid action and two-player mode. It was also a commercial success, but fans of ToeJam &amp; Earl were disappointed and confused by the radical change in direction.

Since its release ToeJam &amp; Earl in Panic on Funkotron has been criticized for being too sharp a departure from the first game, and some later reviewers felt that the developers had been more interested in the publisher's wishes than the fans. Johnson and Voorsanger have stated they regret moving away from their prototype sequel in the vein of ToeJam &amp; Earl. Research has suggested that a significant minority of fans favor ToeJam &amp; Earl in Panic on Funkotron as the best in the series. Together with its predecessor, the game comprises one of the Mega Drive's "key exclusive franchises", which eventually spawned a third installment in 2002, albeit a commercial failure with mixed reviews. ToeJam &amp; Earl in Panic on Funkotron was re-released in 2007 for the Wii's Virtual Console, receiving mixed reviews. The game was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade alongside its prequel in November 2012. In August 2014, ToeJam Earl 2 was listed on GamesRadar at #10 on "Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time".[2]</Overview>

    <Overview>The player takes the role of Captain Scott Mitchell, who is a squad leader of the Ghosts. The game takes place in Mexico City where separatists have attacked an North American summit, leading to the Canadian Prime Minister being killed and the Mexican and US presidents gone missing. Throughout the campaign the player will need to rescue the presidents, recover a nuclear football and defeat the leader of the separatists.

This version of the game has a more streamlined level design and is less tactical than the other versions of the game and is entirely played from a first person perspective. The player here only has one AI-controlled team mate with him and not a full squad. In this version the player isn't able to go prone and can't jump over fences or climbing obstacles, instead the player is able to sprint.</Overview>

    <Name>Tom Clancy's Rainbow 6: Patriots</Name>
    <Overview>Tom Clancy's Rainbow 6: Patriots is a cancelled first-person shooter video game, part of the Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six series, announced on the cover of the December 2011 issue of Game Informer. It was to be published by Ubisoft, and was developed by the company's Montreal studio, with additional development by Ubisoft Toronto and Ubisoft Red Storm. Due to the death of Tom Clancy in October 2013, concern was raised that this game would become the last to bear his name. Ubisoft has since stated that they will continue putting Tom Clancy's name on future Tom Clancy titles out of respect for the late author.

Patriots was cancelled in 2014 after it was announced in 2011. Instead, Ubisoft started development on a new Rainbow Six game called Siege.</Overview>

    <Name>Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Blacklist</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2013-08-20T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The game starts with Sam Fisher and his old friend Victor Coste who are about to depart from Andersen Air Force Base in Guam when an unknown enemy force destroys the entire base. Assisted by hacker specialist Charlie Cole, Sam and Vic manage to escape, although Vic is severely injured from protecting Sam from a grenade. Soon after, a terrorist organization calling itself "The Engineers" claims responsibility for the attack and announces that this attack is the first of a deadly countdown of escalating attacks on United States assets which they call "The Blacklist." They declare that they will halt the attacks only after the U.S. Government recalls all American troops deployed abroad.

In response, President of the United States Patricia Caldwell, who had just shut down the corrupt Third Echelon, assigns Fisher, Charlie Cole, Isaac Briggs and Anna 'Grim' Grímsdóttir to a newly created special operations and counter-terrorism unit called "Fourth Echelon." She installs Sam as the commander and charges the unit with the task of hunting down The Engineers and stopping them. Fourth Echelon's base of operations is a customizable cargo plane, codenamed "Paladin."

Sam and his new team's first course of action is to capture Andriy Kobin from a CIA safe house in Benghazi, Libya and obtain information from which they can learn more about The Engineers' plans. Sam successfully extracts Kobin and arrests him, keeping him aboard the Paladin. Kobin reveals some information about his business associates in Mirawa, Iraq. Infiltrating an insurgent stronghold there, Sam learns that the Blacklist attacks are more serious than originally thought. Sam arrives at a death chamber to find an executed US soldier whose execution was taped. The executioner was Majid Sadiq (Carlo Rota),[7] a terrorist and former MI6 agent. In the video, Sadiq directly tells Sam to stop intervening or suffer the consequences.

Intelligence from Mirawa points to the next Blacklist attack being in Dallas, Texas. Sam asserts to Fourth Echelon that a direct attack would be too simple and that the true target is another city. Charlie notes that the TSA list of "do not fly" citizens was offline for roughly six hours with a group of men traveling through Chicago's O'Hare International Airport during the time the list was offline. The target is a water filtration plant off Navy Pier, which is scheduled to release a hazardous biological agent into the water supply of Chicago. Sam stops the devices and shuts off the outflow valve, sparing Chicago.

Kobin reveals to Sam back on the Paladin intelligence about one of his associates, a dealer named Reza Nouri who supplies mercenaries for hire. Sam assaults his mansion in Ciudad del Este, Paraguay and interrogates Nouri. Nouri states that to whom he lends his men is none of Sam's business. During the interrogation, Nouri's mansion comes under attack from suspected operators of Quds Force. Nouri agrees to give up Sadiq in exchange for a safe extraction.

Grim and Charlie gain intelligence about a sleeper cell of The Engineers in London, England. The cell has been activated and Sam infiltrates an abandoned mill to gain intelligence on The Engineers' next plans. Sam finds shipping documents from Iran, confirming the suspicion that Iran and Quds Force were involved in the Blacklist attacks. With the last of the chemical bombs about to leave the shipping bay, Sam sneaks onto the truck and places a GPS tracking device inside the bomb. Sam is exposed to near lethal amounts of the chemical agent and, while trying to exfiltrate, is captured alive by Sadiq. Briggs, who was providing sniper overwatch, is forced to rescue Sam, but lets Sadiq escape.

After healing from the exposure to the chemical weapons, Sam infiltrates the former US embassy in Tehran, Iran, which has been transformed into a Quds Force headquarters. Sam installs a flash drive on a mainframe computer given to him by Charlie, which is programmed to search and rip anything related to the Blacklist attacks. The flash drive reveals nothing, proving that Iran is not behind the Blacklist attacks, reversing previous suspicions.

Back on the Paladin, Briggs informs Sam that the GPS tracker placed inside the bomb in London has reached US soil in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Grim analyzes that there are a total of four bombs containing hazardous nerve agents. The bombs arrive at the transit yards in Philadelphia, forcing Sam and Briggs to disarm the bombs before the nerve agents are released into the mass transit system. Grim's analysis also assess that a high value Engineer target is present. After Sam and Briggs successfully defuse the fourth bomb, Sam gives chase to the Engineer leader in the transit system. The Engineer escapes the train, but is shot dead on site by responding police officers.

Returning to the Paladin empty handed, Fourth Echelon is given a break when Nouri is checked in as a prisoner in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Sam and Briggs form a plan to break into Guantanamo to interrogate Nouri again under Briggs' CIA credentials. Sam successfully interrogates Nouri who confirms that Sadiq is the mastermind behind the Blacklist attacks, but is unable to tell Sam when the next attack will be. Nouri also admits that Sadiq knows of Fourth Echelon and is aware of the team's individual identities. Sam evades capture and escapes the prison, riding off from the bay with the help of Briggs in a boat. Briggs drives himself and Sam to the Paladin, which has landed at an airstrip in the Yucatán province of Mexico.

Before Fourth Echelon can take off, the Paladin comes under assault by terrorists. Sam and Fourth Echelon fight off the attack, which Charlie reveals was his fault for contacting an old friend while landed. After taking off, the Paladin comes under a cyberattack directly from Sadiq. All of the intelligence on board the Paladin is compromised, as well as the on-board computers, leading the Paladin towards a crash in the Gulf of Mexico. Fourth Echelon successfully regains control of the Paladin, averting the crash. During the cyberattack, Sadiq successfully executes the "American Fuel" Blacklist attack on Sabine Pass, Louisiana, the largest oil reserve in the US.

While the US government activates continuity of government procedures, Sam assaults Sabine Pass, shutting down the leaking oil from reaching other reserve posts, averting a chain reaction. Another high value Engineer is present, to whom Sam gives chase. The Engineer reveals the true and final plans of Sadiq: to extract all US military secrets. Knowing continuity of government procedures, Sadiq successfully kidnaps a group of high level civilian and military personnel, including the Secretary Of Defense, and holds them at the Site F government bunker under Denver International Airport (DIA).

Fourth Echelon calls President Caldwell, who directly orders Fourth Echelon to divert from Denver. The Paladin pilots refuse to defy orders, so Sam orders Kobin to relieve the pilots of duty. Kobin successfully drops Briggs and Sam during a blackout landing at Denver. Briggs and Sam assault DIA, tasked with planting a virus which Charlie custom-built to safeguard against the transfer of files to Sadiq. Briggs surrenders to Sadiq in the computer terminal, separated from the other hostages. Sadiq's men torture the Secretary of Defense into complying with their demands, but Briggs intervenes, killing the Secretary before he can begin the data transfer.

The Engineers attempts to flee Site F using Briggs and the other hostages as human shields. It is revealed that Sam is disguised in an Air Force uniform at the very rear of the hostage group. Sam breaks free from his captors as Delta Force marksmen open fire on Sadiq and his men, and Sadiq escapes on foot after wounding Briggs. An unarmed Sam gives chase, disarming and assaulting Sadiq, before wounding him and taking him into custody. Even upon defeat, Sadiq claims that he has already "won," threatening Sam that if he kills him, the twelve nations who are secretly backing The Engineers will rise and if he puts him on trial, he will "spill every secret he knows." Leaving him with no choice, Sam employs the Fifth Freedom and unofficially imprisons Sadiq, while President Caldwell announces that he is killed and the game ends with Fourth Echelon prepares to continue operations. In the post-credits, it is revealed that Vic had recovered from his injuries and both he and Sam are seen about to interrogate the captive Sadiq.</Overview>

    <Name>Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Pandora Tomorrow HD</Name>
    <Overview>In Pandora Tomorrow, you reprise your role as Sam Fisher, along with old friends Irving Lambert and Anna Grimsdottir.

A terrorist has a disease which he plans to spread through the United States. He makes daily phone calls to an undisclosed location every day, delaying the release of the disease by one more day. As Fisher, you must find out who the terrorist is, where he is, who he is working for, and above all, stop him.

In order to do this, you are taken all around the world, from Paris to Indonesia to the holy land Jerusalem. Sam comes equipped with his standard pistol and SC-20K. The SC has been improved, with an added scope with two levels of zoom. You have access to all the equipment from the first game, including Sticky Shockers, Diversion Cameras, Frag and Smoke Grenades.

Sam has also learned some new moves. He has the ability to perform a SWAT turn, which allows him to pass from one side of an open door to the other without being spotted. He may perform a half-split jump, enabling him to lean against one side of a wall to give him boost to jump higher. He can also whistle, to attract the attention of any nearby enemies.

Pandora Tomorrow also has a full fledged multiplayer game, playable on Xbox Live. The multiplayer ties in to the single player campaign, and it pits the Shadownet team (spies) against the Argus team (mercs). The game supports four players.

Members of Shadownet must infiltrate various complexes to retrieve canisters of a deadly liquid, but they must watch out for cameras, motion sensors and trip lasers, all of which alert the mercs to their position. The spy cannot kill with weapons, but he can stun the mercs for several seconds in order to sneak up and kill from behind.

On the other side, the mercs must make their way to each canister, guarding it from the Shadownet team. Whenever an alarm is tripped, the merc is instantly alerted to where the spy is. To help fight the Shadownets, the mercs have a built-in motion sensor view, which picks up any moving objects, as well as an electromagnetic view, which picks up on spy gadgets. The mercs come equipped with a rifle, and must defend the viral canisters at all costs.

Multiplayer comes with a good variety of maps, ranging from a warehouse and a factory to a cinema and three towering skyscrapers. More maps will be available in the future via Xbox Live.</Overview>

    <Name>Tomb Raider: The Final Hours Edition</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2013-03-05T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Tomb Raider is a 2013 action-adventure video game published by Square Enix. Tomb Raider is the fourth title developed by Crystal Dynamics in the Tomb Raider franchise. As the first entry in a new Tomb Raider continuity, the game is a reboot that emphasises the reconstructed origins of the culturally influential lead character Lara Croft.[4][5] Tomb Raider was released on 5 March 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, and on 23 January 2014 for OS X.

Crystal Dynamics began development of Tomb Raider soon after the release of Tomb Raider: Underworld in 2008. Rather than a sequel, the team decided to completely reboot the series, establishing the origins of Lara Croft for the second time, following Tomb Raider: Legend. Tomb Raider is set on Yamatai, an island from which Lara, who is untested and not yet the battle-hardened explorer she is in other titles in the series, must save her friends and escape while being hunted down by a malevolent cult. Gameplay elements focus more on survival, although exploration is used within the game when exploring the island and various optional tombs. It is also the first game in the series to have multiplayer and the first game to be published by Square Enix, after the latter's acquisition of Eidos Interactive in 2009. Camilla Luddington was announced to voice and perform as Lara Croft in 2010, replacing Keeley Hawes.

After a delayed release from late 2012 to March 2013, Tomb Raider received much anticipation and hype. Upon release, the game was well received, with critics praising the graphics, the gameplay, Luddington's performance as Lara, and Lara's characterization and development, although the addition of the multiplayer mode was criticised. Tomb Raider sold one million copies within 48 hours of its release, and has sold more than 8.5 million copies as of April 2015, making it the best-selling Tomb Raider title to date. An updated version, Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition, was released in North America on 28 January 2014 and in Europe on 31 January 2014 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One containing all features and DLC. A sequel, Rise of the Tomb Raider, was released in November 2015.</Overview>

    <Name>Tomb Raider: Underworld</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2008-11-18T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Tomb Raider: Underworld is an action-adventure video game, the eighth instalment of the Tomb Raider series, following character Lara Croft. The story continues from the events in Tomb Raider: Legend as a direct sequel, but also addresses unexplained plot elements by association with Tomb Raider: Anniversary.[6] Underworld was released by Eidos Interactive for the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows, in North America on 18 November 2008, Europe on 21 November 2008 and Australia on 5 December 2008. On 14 June 2012, Underworld was released on the Mac OS X by Feral Interactive.[7][8] It is the third game in the series to be developed by Crystal Dynamics and is also the first Tomb Raider game to be released on the PlayStation 3. Developers implemented new features into the gameplay, such as the dual-target feature and an upgraded inventory system, using an Active Sonar map and a multi-purpose grappling hook. The game also features a hint system and a new melee combat system where Lara has the ability to battle her opponents using kicks and grapple pulls. Downloadable content was also released exclusively for the Xbox 360, where the player takes control of Lara and her doppelgänger in two new chapters.

Underworld received mostly positive reviews for the PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, and PC versions. Critics generally praised the environments, Lara's motion captured movements, story, puzzles, exploration, graphics and the less linear style of gameplay, although some criticism was directed at its "haywire" camera angles and "dodgy" combat system. The PlayStation 2 and Wii versions received mostly moderate to negative reviews. Most cited them as having medium to poor graphics; being oversimplified; "dumbed" down; and bugged, especially the PlayStation 2 version. On 27 February 2009, Eidos announced that the game had sold around 2.6 million copies worldwide.[9] On 22 May 2009, Tomb Raider: Underworld was re-released as part of the Xbox Classics and Platinum Range lines for Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, respectively.[10] Underworld, along with Legend and Anniversary, was included in the The Tomb Raider Trilogy compilation, which was released in March 2011 for the PlayStation 3. In the end of 2011, Tomb Raider: Underworld was offered for free to PlayStation Plus members.[11]</Overview>

    <Name>Tony Hawk: Ride</Name>
    <Overview>Tony Hawk: Ride is a spin-off in the Tony Hawk's series of video games. The game was released on November 17, 2009 for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360[4] and Wii.[5] It was released in Australia on March 10, 2010.[6]

Having the lowest ratings and worst sales for a Tony Hawk game, Ride debuted to negative critical and commercial reception. It has been widely criticized by video game critics as the worst of the series. It also failed to meet financial predictions, and led to a severe financial drop that risked cancellation of future Tony Hawk games.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2012-08-28T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater HD is a downloadable title for PSN and Xbox LIVE Arcade that takes the best elements of the classic THPS games and gives them a fresh update to create an all new skateboarding experience. Tapping into fans' muscle memories, the gameplay returns to controllers and focuses on the satisfaction of linking sick tricks for maximum points. Combining sharp visuals with the best controls ever in a Tony Hawk game, the feel is cutting edge yet timeless. The game was rebuilt and polished by Robomodo using Neversoft's original code and includes the best seven levels from THPS and THPS2 (Warehouse, School 2, Mall, Phoenix, Hangar, Marseilles and Venice). There is a combination of new school and old school pros (Nyjah Huston, Chris Cole, Eric Koston, Andrew Reynolds, Rodney Mullen, Lyn-z Adams Hawkins Pastrana, Riley Hawk and Tony Hawk himself) and the soundtrack is half classic THPS tracks and fresh ones. Multiple online multiplayer modes round out the action!</Overview>

    <Name>Tony Hawk's Proving Ground</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2007-10-15T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Tony Hawk's Proving Ground is a video game developed by Vicarious Visions for the Nintendo DS, by Neversoft for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 and by Page 44 Studios for the PlayStation 2 and Wii. Proving Ground is the ninth installment in the Tony Hawk's series, and the last to be developed by Neversoft as the franchise was then transferred to Robomodo.

Proving Ground was not as successful as Project 8 (2006). When it debuted in 2007, critics were hesitant about its controls, despite receiving praise for its visuals and audio. Amidst this somewhat lackluster reception, it was a financial success. The Xbox 360 version in America came with a demo of Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock, which was released on October 28, 2007.

Proving Ground was the last game in the main series of Tony Hawk games for 8 years until Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 in 2015.[2]</Overview>

    <Name>Top Spin 4</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-03-15T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Top Spin 4 is the fourth instalment in Top Spin tennis game series. Users play choosing from a roster of 25 real-world players comprehensive of active professionals and past glories, or opt for a player created by themselves, on real-world tournaments courts and other fictional ones.

Shots divide firstly into controlled and power shots, performed respectively by tapping or charging related button (if charge is not complete, resulting shot will be a blend of the two types). Ball speed and trajectory depend by shot type, player characteristics, player position, characteristics of the shot that is to be returned, remaining stamina, and timing. Timing expresses the player's ability in pressing shot button at the right time, and ranges from Too Late to Perfect. Once the opponent has hit the ball, one's player movement starts when the gamer pushes a direction and since then is determined by the CPU.

Standard baseline shot types are flat, slice, top spin, lob, and drop shots; volley shots can be normal, controlled, power, and drop volleys; serves can be flat slice and topspin, and focus on precision (standard serve) or power (advanced serve).

Offline game modes are Exhibition, Career, King of the Court, and Top Spin Academy, that is a tutorial mode in which the fundamentals of the game are explained by a coach and then put in practice by the player.

In Exhibition, it is possible to play a customisable singles or doubles game, choosing location, duration in game and sets, and score rules (including percentage tennis) and difficulty setting, against the computer or other human opponents, up to 4 human players in doubles game.

Career starts with the creation of one's player, which can be a male or a female. Body shape and complexion, face's appearance, and outfit are customisable, with the presence of branded raquets and sportswear. Created player starts their career from low level tournaments, and, in an RPG manner, gains experience points to rise in level and attributes, the objective being reaching Majors and fame. Bonus special skills and extra statistic rises are achievable by choosing from more than 30 coaches and fulfilling their requests (like, as an example: play 30 baseline winners, or win 20 points at the net). Depending on one's levelling choices, players of any style can be created: however, their complexive skills can't equal those of in-game real world players. Created players may be used in any customised match, and online World Tour.

King of the Court is a party tennis match, featuring few-points long matches: the loser leaves the court, another player takes their place: who wins the final match is the winner.

Online game modes are Player Match, World Tour, 2K Open.

Player match consists in a single game, just as offline exhibition. Playing doubles requires 4 players, and each pair is demanded to be playing together physically.

World Tour is a competition that imitates real ATP pro circuit for which created players only can be used. There is a weekly, and an all-time ranking, male and female competitions are separated, and the choice to change one's player means previous statistics be erased.

2K Open features matches lasting 3 sets of 3 games each (last set is a super tie-break, a tie-break won at 10 points); pro players only can be used. There is an all-time ranking specific to this mode.

Parameters determining player performance are: Forehand, Backhand, Serve, Volley, Power, Stamina, Speed, Reflexes. All players have special skills (3 for pro players, up to 2 for created ones) such as Diesel Serve (serve gets better proceeding in a game), Reach Swings Expert (hardly-reached balls are returned better than other players would), Poisoned Slice, No Mercy, and others. 

Male pro players are: Federer, Nadal, Djokovic, Murray, Roddick, Davydenko, Simon, Blake, Wawrinka, Tomic, Agassi, Sampras, Borg, Becker, Courier, Rafter, Chang and Lendl. Female professionals are: Serena Williams, Wozniachi, Ivanovic, Safina, Jankovic, Zvonareva, Bouchard.

The game is compatible with PlayStation Move and supports stereoscopic 3D on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. Wii version controls are rearranged to focus on Wii Remote's motion-sensing feature.</Overview>

    <Overview>The Wind Warriors, a group of spirits making unknown planets habitable, comes across a hero named Omegaton. He's weak due to his power orbs being stolen by a group known as the Fire Flyers, who have scattered them across Earth. Your mission, as Wind Warrior Zephyr? Defeat the Fire Flyers and retrieve the orbs - by tearing the Earth apart.

Tornado Outbreak is a Katamari Damacy-type game with a huge emphasis on chaos and destruction. You initially start off as a small tornado, and the more destruction means the tornado becomes bigger, but players must stay in clouds and shadows and avoid sunlight, or else it's game over. Aside from destroying buildings, players must find Fire Flyers and absorb them in the tornado, which grants new abilities. Players will also have to participate in races and boss battles in order to advance to the next level as well. For multiplayer action, two players can play through the game via co-op.</Overview>

    <Overview>Tower of Guns is a fast-paced randomized FPS for the twitch gamer, a short burst "Lunch Break FPS" not unlike FTL or Binding of Isaac mixed with Doom 2. If you're gonna win, you're gonna do it within an hour. That's a big if though... it won't be easy.

With random enemies, random power ups, random bosses, tons of unlockable items and weapons...and even random-level composition - you never know what to expect! So grab a rocket-launcher, slap a shotgun-modifier on it, pick up a hundred stackable 'double jumps' (or centuple jumps at that point, I suppose) and get to conquering the Tower of Guns!

Tower of Guns was made by a guy named Joe (with his brother Mike composing the music).
A gratuitous amount of bullets and projectiles!

Randomized levels, enemies, loot, and mobs makes for a highly replayable experience.

”Lunch-Break” style play sessions: the perfect game for the gamer with not a lot of time.</Overview>

    <Overview>Toy Story 3: The Video Game is a platform video game loosely based on the film Toy Story 3. It was published by Disney Interactive Studios (which is the developer for iOS) and developed by Avalanche Software (PS3, Wii, Xbox 360, PC, Mac OS X), Asobo Studio (PS2, PSP) and n-Space (DS).

A special PlayStation 2 bundle with Toy Story 3: The Video Game was released on October 31, 2010, followed by the game's individual release on November 2, 2010.[1][2] It's the only video game based on the Toy Story franchise to be released for the PlayStation 2, as well as the last video game based on a Disney and/or Pixar product on the console.

Toy Story 3 is the first game based on a film by Pixar to be published entirely by Disney Interactive Studios. Past Disney/Pixar movie games have been made in conjunction with Activision first, then THQ.[3] It is the sequel to the second game that was based on the second film in the franchise.

Most of the voice cast from the film returned to reprise their characters in the game with the exception of Tom Hanks (Woody) and Tim Allen (Buzz Lightyear). Jim Hanks returned to voice Woody from the Toy Story 2 game, and Mike MacRae voiced Buzz. The game also contains content exclusive to the PlayStation 3 version that allows the player(s) to turn into Zurg in Woody's Round up.[4] The game was well received by critics and was a top-seller in the UK.</Overview>

    <Name>Trine 2</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-12-20T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Trine 2 is the sequel to the action puzzle platformer Trine. It once again stars three characters – Amadeus the wizard, Zoya the thief, and Pontius the knight – who need to work together and use their complimentary skills to progress through levels filled with enemies and physics-based puzzles. The game picks up the story when the trine is rediscovered and brings the three characters back together. It transports them to an unknown world where their progress is overlooked by a mysterious figure referred to as The Witch. Later in the game her true identity and purposes are revealed. The story further involves the Goblin King and his minions, as well as the tale of two sisters who are also princesses.

Just like in the first game players can freely switch between the three characters to tackle the environment-based challenges. The knight is strong and most suited for close combat, the thief is agile and has long-ranged attacks, and the wizard is a feeble character that uses magic to manipulate items. Many of the original abilities are still present. The wizard creates boxes and planks as temporary platforms, the thief uses grapple to cross large gaps, and the knight is able to deflect projectiles with his shield. New abilities are unlocked through a skill tree shared by the characters, and some of the new options allow the wizard to chuck opponents around or for the thief to upgrade her arrows with new enhancements. Skill points are earned by locating vials. There is no longer an inventory with items gathered from treasure chests for additional upgrades. Instead the chests yield poetry that reveal bits of the story.

The game can be played cooperatively with three players each controlling a character simultaneously. This can be done both offline and, new for this sequel, online. When a character dies, it can be revived at the next checkpoint. There are two new gameplay modes that are available right away. There is Game+ that allows players to go through the game again with their fully upgraded characters from the start. The second one is called Unlimited Character Mode and it allows players to assemble a party of any combination of characters, for instance using just three thieves. The game design always offers multiple approaches to over the challenges.</Overview>

The United Kingdom is subdued by Nazi Germany in 1940, and the rest of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East fall soon afterward. The United States, infected with anti-war sentiment, does not get involved overseas. The game takes place in the midst of the Greater German Reich's invasion and occupation of the East Coast of the United States in 1953.[4]</Overview>

    <Name>Uncharted 2: Among Thieves</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-10-13T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>In Uncharted 2: Among Thieves fortune hunter Nathan Drake embarks on a journey that will push him to his physical, emotional and intellectual limits to discover the real truth behind the lost fleet of Marco Polo and the legendary Himalayan valley of Shambhala, more commonly known in the west as Shangri-La. 

Although gameplay in Among Thieves is similar to that of the previous game, there are several major differences. The most important of these is the addition of several online multiplayer options. Unfortunately, no offline multiplayer could be included in the game due to the impact local split-screening has on the game's graphical quality. Thankfully though, the online modes included cover both co-op and competitive play. See the feature list below for details on these. In addition to play modes players can also expect a wealth of new gameplay features including a new stealth gameplay mechanic and altered climbing mechanic - both of which are extended to the AI of enemies; the ability to create cover by flipping over certain found items; the use of riot shields for defense and offense; and a complete lack of loading screens.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2009-10-01T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Uncharted 2: Among Thieves is a 2009 action-adventure third-person shooter platform video game developed by Naughty Dog and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 3 game console.[5] It is a sequel to the 2007 game Uncharted: Drake's Fortune. It was first shown and announced on December 1, 2008.[6] Officially announced in the January 2009 issue of Game Informer, it was released in October 2009.[2][4]

The story follows Nathan Drake, as he travels around the world, along with Chloe Frazer and old friends Elena Fisher and Victor Sullivan to find the fabled Cintimani Stone and Shangri-La in a race against Serbian mercenaries. The plot draws heavy inspiration from Marco Polo and his travels through Asia, which sets many plot points along the way.

A widespread critical success, Uncharted 2 received praise for its elaborate set pieces, character design, storytelling, graphics, technical innovation, and gameplay mechanics. It was named by Metacritic as the most critically acclaimed game of 2009.[7] It went on to win the Game of the Year (or equivalent) award from each of the following: IGN, Eurogamer, Game Informer, Joystiq, Kotaku, Giant Bomb, AIAS, X-Play, Game Developers Choice Awards, and the Spike Video Game Awards for the year 2009. It is widely considered one of the greatest video games of all time. The game has also proved a commercial success, having since sold over 6 million copies worldwide.

A sequel, Uncharted 3: Drake's Deception, was released in November 2011.[8] The game was re-released for the PlayStation 4 in October 2015, along with the other two entries in the series as part of Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection.[9]</Overview>

    <Name>Uncharted Waters Online</Name>
    <Overview>Uncharted Waters Online, originally released as Daikoukai Jidai Online (大航海時代 Online?) in Japan, is a MMORPG developed by KOEI based on the Uncharted Waters series of games. Set in the Age of Exploration, it features over a hundred different sailing ships and an open world based on real Earth geography. With a sandbox style game play and skill based character development, players interact with each other and engage in many activities such as combat, exploration, and trade on both sea and land. The game requires monthly subscription fee in Japan but the international server is free to play.

Uncharted Waters Online is available on the Windows platform in simplified Chinese, traditional Chinese, English, Japanese and Korean, also available on the PlayStation 3 since 2009.[1] Six years after the initial Asian release, Netmarble produced the game, under its traditional English title, for the non-Asian market in North America and Europe.[2] On August 19, 2010, the official site for English and US game versions was opened [3] and closed beta was announced. The open beta began on October 1, 2010. Beta testing was completed, and the game is now live in North America and Europe. In November 2013, the global Netmarble service ended and was transferred to OGPlanet.[4] A high-definition PlayStation 4 version has been announced for a September 15, 2015 release.[5]</Overview>

Until Dawn was met with a positive critical response upon release, with praise directed at the visuals, 'choice' mechanic, horror elements, music, characters, voice acting, and gameplay design. Most of the criticism the game drew concerned the second half of the story, the camera angles, character movement, and the game's partially linear plot.</Overview>

    <Name>Vampire Rain: Altered Species</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2008-08-26T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Vampire Rain is a stealth game similar in nature to the Splinter Cell or Metal Gear series. Players are tasked with navigating their character through city streets, while avoiding the vampire enemies that patrol the streets disguised as ordinary human citizens. Players often have to take alternate routes, such as climbing onto rooftops or through alleys, to avoid enemy encounters.

Unlike most stealth-action games, Vampire Rain places heavy emphasis on pure stealth. Enemies are extremely fast and can kill the player in two hits; the first hit usually immobilizes the player, giving the vampire sufficient time to land a second, killing blow. Additionally, for the first third of the game, players lack any weaponry that can kill vampires effectively without spending a large amount of ammunition. In effect, most attempts to initiate combat generally result in the player's death. Also, unlike most stealth games, there is usually no effective means to hide or escape once an enemy has spotted the player, which results in the player dying soon after being spotted. Successful completion of many missions thus generally requires total avoidance of enemies by figuring out the correct route to pass through the mission area without being detected.

Later in the game, players are given high-powered weapons which prove more effective against the game's vampire enemies. Also, there are a few pre-scripted action sequences that involve fighting against multiple enemies, generally with the assistance of teammates or special environmental hazards. The player's arsenal includes a handgun, submachine gun, assault rifle, shotgun, sniper rifle, anti-armor rifle and a UV Knife used to stab an enemy from behind for an instant kill.

If the player collects enough "Medals" that are either placed in hidden or difficult to reach spots throughout the game as well as passing certain missions under certain conditions such as within a time-limit, without needing to retry from a checkpoint or without killing any Nightwalkers will reward the player with extra side-missions and challenges.

Online multiplayer involves up to eight players in standard modes such as deathmatch, team deathmatch and capture the flag, as well as the unique mode which allows one to become a nightwalker and fight opponents with extreme speed and power. All the firearms are available online and the gameplay is handled like in single-player.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2007-03-20T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Virtua Tennis 3 features 20 international tennis stars like Roger Federer, Lindsay Davenport or Maria Sharapova against which you need to compete in the heart of the game: The World Tour. You create your own character and play to reach the number one rank on the world ranking list.

Virtua Tennis 3 is not a simulation like Top Spin 2 and only needs three buttons to perform all possible shot. Still time needs to be invested in training the character through several mini-games in which need you to hit a circle on the other side of the net or defeat aliens by hitting them with returns.

You can also play as one of the professionals against the CPU or a friend (or two if you play a Double). True to the series of the home version, there are also 12 mini-games available to play against your friends. These include the ones from the World Tour training as well as different ones like Curling or Super-Bingo. The Tournament Mode and Exhibition Mode are also present in the arcade version, but the Challenge Mode has been replaced by the World Tour Mode and Party Mode.</Overview>

    <Name>Virtua Tennis 4</Name>
    <Overview>Virtua Tennis 4 is an action-oriented tennis game which focuses on fast matches instead of being a realistic simulation. The heart of the game is the career mode in which the player creates his own avatar. The goal is simple: reaching the top within four seasons. Here the player has various possibilities to improve his tennis player, e.g. by playing training sessions (arcade mini game like picking up eggs) to improve the statistics, buying new clothes with prize money or playing matches. The menu for this mode is made up like a board game.

Other playing modes are single matches, party mode (playing the mentioned mini games) or arcade (winning as many matches in a row as possible). Here players can choose between 19 licensed athletes (plus at release already retired athletes in the PlayStation 3 version). The standard controls for returning the ball consist of choosing the wished move, e.g. a spin, and the basic direction. When a special bar is filled up, players can unleash an especially powerful hit.</Overview>

    <Overview>Warriors Orochi 3 is the third installment in the Warriors Orochi series and the sequel of Warriors Orochi 2.

After vanquishing Orochi, a period of peace came to the land. That peace is suddenly shattered by the appearance of a Hydra. Warriors from different worlds gather to father the Hydra, but only three survive. With the help of the mystic Kaguya, Sima Zhao, Ma Chao and Hanbei Takenaka set to travel in time to save their fallen comrades and form an army against the new threat.

Starting with only four characters, the player sets to gather warriors by altering the outcome of different battles. The characters consist of the characters from the Dynasty Warriors series and Samurai Warriors series and a few from other games such as Ninja Gaiden and Dead or Alive.

The player chooses three warriors before each stage. In battle, these characters can switch places at any time to fight against hordes of enemy soldiers and officers, gathering experience and gems until the victory conditions are met. Weapons and items can also be acquired in battle. Between each battle, the player is sent back to the camp, where he can buy and customize weapons, make characters bond together, equip the characters and distribute growth points to raise the character's level. If certain conditions are met, discussions between specific warriors will unlock new stages or an alternate "Redux" version of a previously cleared battle.</Overview>

    <Overview>The storyline of Watch Dogs game is built around the concept of information warfare, data being interconnected, and the world's increasing use of technology—questioning who exactly runs the computers they depend on. The game is set in an alternate reality version of Chicago, Illinois, which is one of many cities to feature a supercomputer known as a "CtOS" (Central Operating System). The system controls almost every piece of technology in the city, and contains information on all of the city's residents and activities which can be used for various purposes. In the game's universe, the Northeast blackout of 2003 was found to be caused by a hacker, prompting the development of CtOS. The game will follow a man named Aiden Pearce, a highly skilled hacker described as a person who uses both "fists and wits." The gameplay demo shown at E3 2012 depicted Aiden's attempt to assassinate a media mogul named Joseph DeMarco, who had been wrongly acquitted on charges of murder. In a demonstration shown at E3 2013, Pearce helps a fellow hacker named T-Bone escape after he is discovered attempting to steal a motherboard.</Overview>

    <Name>Way of the Samurai 4</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-03-03T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Way of the Samurai 4 (侍道4, Samurai Dou 4) is a video game developed by Acquire and published by Spike for the PlayStation 3. It was released in Japan on March 3, 2011.

Endings, Events, and Customization
Acquire promised that 4 would be much longer than previous games, and there are 10 endings. The game also features flexible events and cutscenes such as deciding whether you want to explore a cave or just turn around and walk away. Events are easier to follow, compared to previous games. There are more customization options than in the last game, allowing to choose features such as face, hair, clothing, footwear and accessories.

Health and Energy
An energy meter is added in this installment. It regenerates life points (which are set at 1000) if the player is stationary or moving away in combat, and depletes when your samurai fights, nightcrawls, or is regenerating health. Food and sleep regenerate the energy meter. There are straw blankets in set locations outside (or in) the dojo, inns around Amihama where you pay to sleep in, and any bed you can stand on can be used to sleep and recharge energy.

Combat
There is a wide variety of fighting styles and skills that a player can master. Swords can now be switched to any stance; and skills, once learned, are bound to the player, not the swords. Players then can assign learned skills to their own "school" of fighting style.

The "push and pull" mechanics in the first and third games are kept. A new special mode is introduced, in which the samurai enters slow motion for a limited duration and can slash enemies repeatedly, then he sheathes the sword and all dead enemies fall down at the same time.

The sword "heat" mechanics was removed and replaced by "durability points", which will drop gradually with use, and eventually weapons will break. This forces players to visit the blacksmith regularly for repairs, unless their weapons are "unbreakable".

Sword Enhancement/Creation
Players can go to the blacksmith and choose to enhance their weapon's attributes (attack, defense, durability), repair it, or appraise it. Player can also ask Dojima to melt a sword and then use the metal to recast another sword.

The custom sword-making system introduced in Way of the Samurai 3 returns. In addition to normal parts like blade, hilt and grip, players can also add a charm that will give a special effect. Beside swords and spears, pistols and muskets have been added as weapons. Muskets are primarily used by British soldiers.

Proof of Life
Player's actions will affect the game world in the next replay. For example, if players killed a lot of town people in the last game, there will be more guards to hunt them down. There are many foreigners in the game; but unlike the previous game, at the beginning the protagonist will not be able to understand what they say (the texts will appear as "?????"). Players can convince the Shogunate to open a school to teach foreign languages, and later the player will be able talk to foreigners.

Night Crawling
There is a minigame called "Yobai" in which a samurai can romance a NPC by sneaking into their home at night, avoiding or knocking out family members, and pulling out the right futon to find them. Even then, they will offer playful resistance, and player must try to throw them into bed. A turtle head will guide the samurai to their target. The player can practice "night crawling" with most male and female characters in the game, as long as the requirements are fulfilled.

Torture
Once arrested for doing bad deeds, the player's character will be sent to the torture room, to play some hellish minigames with the three beautiful Kinugawa sisters. The tortures include riding a flaming wooden horse, being tied to a water wheel, and being pelted by huge stones. If the samurai survives the torture, the sisters will be impressed, and he can then practice "night crawling" with them.

Minigames
Beside various jobs that the samurai can get from different sources, players can earn money by going fishing, working as an assassin, delivering love letters, or by flirting with foreign women. The samurai can also play poker at the casino, and hanafuda at the gambling parlor.

Dojo
Players can open their own dojo, take on apprentices, and fend off challengers. The reputation of the dojo depends on the number of apprentices, and their quality. The player can tell any of the apprentices to "follow me", and they will fight alongside him.

Crossroads Killing
When connected to PSN, character data will be automatically uploaded and transferred into other players' game worlds, where he would appear as a wandering samurai (NPC), and players can defeat him to obtain the custom sword that another player created. This is called online tsujigiri.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2009-09-15T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Rubi Malone calls herself a problem solver. Others would call her a mercenary. For enough money she does what she's told without asking questions and going over corpses to reach her goals. But one day a guy called Robert Pelham has the guts to double-cross her - a huge mistake. Mad as hell she goes out on a search for vengeance, traveling over several continents and going through hordes and hordes of minions. The whole game is envisioned like a Grindhouse movie with scratches all over the screen, missing scenes, a high amount of blood and gore and a high focus on staged action scenes.

Similar to John Woo presents Stranglehold, WET is a third-person-shooter with a strong focus on acrobatic stunts. While Rubi can kill enemies with her assortment of four different types of weapons (two pistols with unlimited ammo, two shotguns, two machine pistols and two crossbows) just by walking around shooting, she doesn't do much damage that way and is very slow. Instead she needs to jump around, slide across the floor or walk on the walls which instantly slows down time until she touches the floor again. During these moves she can also use both of her weapons to target one enemy automatically while manually using the crosshair to target another. For every kill she makes she gets points and depending on how fast and how "stylish" she kills enemies, her points multiplier increases up to x5. The multiplier is especially important, since Rubi only regenerates health when the multiplier is active, making her nearly invulnerable once she reaches and successfully holds x5. The only other way to regenerate health is to drink from whiskey bottles scattered around the levels. Earned points are used to buy new moves or upgrade existing ones as well as her weapons. She also has access to a sword which she uses as a door-opener and to cut down enemies in melee combat.

Besides the normal combat and the action/adventure-like climbing and jumping exercises in-between, there are simple quick-time events for bossfights and other scripted events and the so-called Rage-mode. At certain, pre-defined points in the game, Rubi kills an enemy at close range and gets blood all over her face. This drives her mad and turns the realistic graphics into a red-black-white cartoon-style world. During rage-mode, Rubi is nearly invulnerable, is faster and hits harder - but also has to deal with many many more enemies. Once the player has finished the game, additional difficulty settings are unlocked including an arcade-mode where each enemy can only take one bullet and Rubi also has considerably less health. In addition a points-mode, in which the player can select each level of the story-mode and try to beat their highscore, and Rubi's home are unlocked. At Rubi's home, an abandoned plane-graveyard, several different challenges await the player like getting from A to B in the fastest time possible, or shooting targets for points.</Overview>

In addition there will be new trophies to attain, a re-styled front-end and a selection of new &amp; improved multiplayer functionality!

The Eliminator game mode will allow you to release all that pent-up aggression as you use the full arsenal of Wipeout weaponry to destroy your opponents. Forget those racing lines; this is all about destruction, with the victor being the first to reach the target score! Zone Battle is about risk and reward! Acceleration is automatic as you swoop over zone pads to fill your zone bar. Your choice is whether to use the bar to increase your speed and boost your ship ever closer to the target zone or absorb it to replenish vital lost energy. Warning, avoid the ‘zone barriers’, obstacles left on the track by your opponents as they boost towards the target zone, hitting these can literally destroy your hopes of victory! And finally, Detonator Mode introduces a brand new ship model to the game that will test both your piloting skills and your shooting accuracy as you accelerate through as many as 14 stages. Score points by destroying the mines that have been strewn along the track and take out the bomb on each stage to earn additional points. The more accurate you are the more points and bonuses you will score!</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2009-08-18T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>In the beginning, a Nazi naval officer and a group of German sailors on board the battleship Tirpitz have been tricked into thinking B.J. Blazkowitz is the general after donning the general's hat, boots, and jacket. After seeing blood dripping from the edge of the jacket, the sailors realize that there's a spy on board who has killed the actual general. As Blazkowitz fights the men on board he's forced to surrender by an officer, who orders him to show him the glowing object hidden in the jacket. 

He finds a mysterious medallion in the general's jacket and the officer orders the men to kill him, but he accidentally pushed the trigger which projects a shield over him that reflects the bullets back at the men, creating a cosmic energy wave that melts the men and officer. Hijacking a plane from a German airman, he escapes off the exploding Tirpitz and returns back to the OSA headquarters. During a meeting at OSA headquarters, he learns that the medallion needs crystals called Nachtsonne (found only in Isenstadt) to make use of its full power. The Nazis have begun digging for crystals, led by a Nazi general named Victor Zetta. Blazkowicz is sent to Isenstadt, but his cover is blown by an unknown informant. He then meets up with agents from the Kreisau Circle, and with them, makes it to Isenstadt.</Overview>

    <Overview>Wolfenstein 3D is a first-person shooter video game developed by id Software and published by Apogee Software. Originally released on May 5, 1992, for the PC operating system DOS, the game was inspired by the 1980s Muse Software video games Castle Wolfenstein and Beyond Castle Wolfenstein. A promotional version of Wolfenstein 3D was released as shareware, which permitted it to be copied widely. The game was later ported to a wide range of computer systems and video game consoles.

The shareware release contains one episode consisting of ten levels. The commercial release consists of three episodes, which include the shareware episode and two subsequent episodes. Later releases included a three-episode mission pack titled The Nocturnal Missions. The player assumes the role of a World War II Allied spy William "B.J." Blazkowicz, who is trying to escape from Castle Wolfenstein, a Nazi German prison. After the initial escape episode, Blazkowicz carries out a series of crucial missions against the Nazis.

Wolfenstein 3D was a critical and commercial success. It is widely regarded as having helped popularize the genre on the PC and having established the basic run-and-gun archetype for many subsequent first-person shooter games.</Overview>

    <Name>WWE '13</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2012-10-30T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>WWE '13 will run on the engine called, "Predator Technology 2.0," which succeeds the first version from WWE '12. The Predator Technology 2.0 game engine has been updated from the previous WWE games to allow for more fluid animations, with odd collisions and transitions having been fixed and updated, it also allows for over 300 new moves. Past problems have been fixed with a better weight detection system, contextual animations and automatic attack homing, to ensure that the character always strikes towards the enemy. The contextual animation system has been refined to ensure that it dynamically swaps out moves to make sure that the game is using the appropriate move animations at any given time and state. The weight detection system makes it so that small superstars such as Rey Mysterio are unable to lift larger wrestlers such as the Big Show. Thus, the contextual animations ensure that more appropriate attacks are put in the superstar's normal moveset. The game's new homing system is designed that when doing high flying moves, a player will hit the intended target with better precision. The homing system also tracks tables so that they will be better detected when doing grapples on a ladder in TLC and Ladder matches.[4]

The game is the first to feature Spectacular Moments, also known as "OMG! Moments." This feature allows players to bug the game to make it seem as ring breaks, barricade breaks, announce table breaks, and catching (mid-air) finishers are possible.[5] The Predator Technology engine has been further updated to include an enhanced audio engine, dubbed WWE Live. Instead of chanting pre-recorded in a warehouse as done in previous WWE games, WWE Live features chanting recorded from live WWE events. To make the audio more authentic, WWE Live features more crowd participation, with the crowd's chants, cheering and booing being dependent on the situation occurring in the match. Sounds were recorded by the WWE Production team and THQ from actual live events. Divas matches have also been updated, with up to six Divas, created and original, being able to compete simultaneously in the ring, a feature absent for many years. WWE '13 will also feature WWE Universe 3.0, which was also further updated to allow the player to edit schedules, television shows, rosters, as well as creating alliances or feuds between several wrestlers.

On September 21, it was confirmed that WWE '13 would contain the I Quit Match for the first time since WWF SmackDown! and the King of The Ring Tournament.[6]</Overview>

    <Name>WWE 2K15</Name>
    <Overview>WWE 2K15 is a professional wrestling video game developed by Yuke's and Visual Concepts, and is published by 2K Sports for the PlayStation 3 (PS3), PlayStation 4 (PS4), Xbox 360, Xbox One and Windows PC. It was succeeded by WWE 2K16. It was released on October 28, 2014 in North America and on October 31, 2014 in Europe for last generation consoles and released on November 18, 2014 in North America and on November 21, 2014 in Europe for current generation consoles. It was released on PC on April 28, 2015 and was the first WWE game to be released on the platform since WWE RAW, which was released in 2002. WWE 2K15 is also the first 2K WWE game to be released on PC.[2][3] The cover features John Cena and is the first in the series to use the new WWE logo introduced in late 2014.

The game is based on the professional wrestling promotion WWE and WWE 2K15 serves as the first game in the series to signify the "new generation", placing a heavy emphasis on traditional and more relaxed gameplay, unlike the arcade-like combat prominent in previous installments. WWE 2K15 adds several new features to compliment main theme based around naturalism, adding a new chain grapple system at the beginning of matches, slowing the pacing of the matches and adding a new stamina bar to reflect and portray the quality of matches produced on WWE television in the game.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2009-02-10T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>At the beginning of time, two divine entities ruled over the universe peacefully and harmoniously. But one day the seeds of conflict rained from the sky and the entity known as The Dark, tried to take all the power for himself. The Light and The Dark battle fiercely but The Light couldn't defeat The Dark and stop the chaos. They were both inseparably connected to one another and so The Light realized that the only way to stop The Dark was to banish him and himself into two cursed artifacts. Each one is now guarding the artifact containing the powers of the other and all seems well. At least until one day a egocentric treasure hunter named Ayumi finds the map to the hidden temple where the artifacts are guarded.

In her greed she ignores the warnings of The Light, touches the artifact and by doing so unleashes The Curse upon herself. It enters her body and condemns her to pain and suffering. But not all is lost. The Curse hasn't full control over her yet. Withstanding it, Ayumi continues to search her search for the second artifact. But now not because of greed but to battle The Dark, confine it's powers again and relieve herself of The Curse by doing so.

The journey is not an easy one as the player takes over the control of Ayumi, looking over her shoulder and guiding her through the levels. The return of The Dark spawned many enemies on the island. But as an experienced treasure hunter, Ayumi isn't defenseless. With her gunblades in her hands, she mows through the enemies like Dante does in the Devil May Cry series until the entrance to the next level unlocks. Each defeated enemy then drops one or more souls which Ayumi needs to buy additional skills, spells and items allowing her to cast fireballs upon her enemies or buy more powerful bullets for the gunblades. This is especially important as all the enemies and bosses have different weaknesses. The phantoms e.g. are immune to physical damage but hitting them with a fireball or fire-induced blades will destroy them in no time.

Scattered around the temple are also artifacts which were broken into three pieces. If Ayumi finds all three, she reunites them and gains either a melee, pistol or airstrike upgrade increasing her respective damage and granting her access to more powerful combos.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2011-03-08T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Yoostar 2: In the Movies is the sequel to the 2009 PC application Yoostar: Be Scene. It is a movie karaoke game where players can act out 80 famous scenes from movies such as 300, The Matrix, The Godfather, Kindergarten Cop, Shaun of the Dead, The Terminator, Frankenstein, The Wizard of Oz and many more. The game uses a rotoscoping technique to filter out the original actors and replace them with the player's image. The game requires a camera function through Kinect (Xbox 360) or PlayStation Eye (PS3) to capture the player, with optional support for Move on the PS3.

The player is put inside the scene and needs to imitate the original motions as well as speak out the lines. Players can either act out the scenes straight or improvise their own lines. The game grades the player based on the imitation of motion and gestures (a silhouette outlines where you should stand in the screen), as well as the rhythm of speaking the lines, similar to the SingStar games. In the Challenge mode there are additional goals while acting out the scenes. Clips can be saved and shared on the Yoostar website, as well as on Facebook and Twitter. Additional movie content is available as DLC.</Overview>
