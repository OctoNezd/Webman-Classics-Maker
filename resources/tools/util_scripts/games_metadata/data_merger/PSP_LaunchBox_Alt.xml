    <Overview>The first game in the .hack series for PSP (and the planned final game for the franchise), .hack//LINK logs player into a new version of its virtual landscape called The World R:X (the "R" stands for "Revision"). Set 10 years after the last .Hack, players take control of Tokio Kuryu, a second year junior-high student. Presented through manga-style visuals, the game's story promises to clear up the mysteries from past entries. Over 100 characters from past .hack games, anime, manga, and books will make an appearance.

Gameplay promises to retain the basics of past titles, with players facing off in battle against enemies as they explore dungeons. The difference here is that you move around in a party of two, with the CPU-controlling the other character. The game will include 33 such CPU-controlled characters. For the PSP game, the battle system has been changed to a more action-heavy combat system.</Overview>

    <Name>12Riven: The Psi-Climinal of Integral</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-04-16T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The story of 12Riven takes place on May 20, 2012 with Renmaru Miyabidō biking his way speedily towards the abandoned Integral (インテグラル Integuraru) building after receiving a message on his cellphone that Myū, an old friend of his, would die at the building's top level today at noon. When he gets there, he checks his wristwatch and sees that it is 11:24 AM.

Elsewhere, Narumi Mishima is on her motorcycle heading towards the same location. She has received a request from a friend and coworker asking her to help save a girl named "Myū" at Integral. Narumi must save Myū to prevent the execution of the "Second Eclipse Plan" (第弐エクリプス計画 Daini Ekuripusu Keikaku). Narumi has never heard of this phrase before, moreover, the message was sent with the "XXX Lv6" marking. This was a rating scale for the severity of a situation and a level 6 marking has never been used. Even a large scale terrorist threat was set at level 5. The message also indicated to Narumi that someone named Renmaru may be there, that he will be on her side.

Renmaru finds nothing at the observation deck of the building, but when he goes outside onto the opening of the building, he finds Myū injured on the ground. Renmaru also finds her attacker there but is unable to defeat him because every time Renmaru tries to connect a blow, he is thrown onto the ground himself by some unknown force. At this point, Myū's attacker draws out a gun, he takes Myū and threatens Renmaru to leave the place quietly after he counts to ten with his eyes closed. Renmaru does not know what to do and stands there hopelessly. Right as the attacker counts down to one, Narumi arrives at the scene and points her gun at him.</Overview>

    <Name>428: Fūsa Sareta Shibuya de</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-09-17T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>428: Fūsa Sareta Shibuya de (Japanese: 428 〜封鎖された渋谷で〜?, literally "428: In a Blockaded Shibuya") is a visual novel and adventure video game created by Kōichi Nakamura and Jiro Ishii.

428: Fūsa Sareta Shibuya de is a visual novel set in the Shibuya ward of Tokyo where the narrative is presented using a combination of scrolling text, live action stills and video sequences. The game shares many story and gameplay elements with Chunsoft's 1998 sound novel game Machi, the most prominent being the locale, Shibuya. Although Chunsoft does not openly state 428 is a sequel, the game contains numerous references to Machi, and an early marketing slogan reads "Breaking a long silence, Shibuya gets going again."

The game has received high praise from critics, earning a perfect score in Famitsu Weekly, Japan's largest circulating video game magazine. The game also features a special scenario contributed by Kinoko Nasu and Takashi Takeuchi of Type-Moon fame, who wrote and provided character designs for them respectively. It was subsequently announced by Sega that this particular scenario by Type-Moon would be adapted into an anime TV series titled Canaan, which began airing in Japan on July 4, 2009. A series of four novels based on the game were published by Kodansha between the months of September and December 2009.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2006-10-24T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Skies of Deception is the second game in the action flight series to appear on the PSP. The player commands the Gryphus Squadron, one of the last to remain for Aurelia with its single airbase, a nation on the southern edge of the Osean Continent. In 2020, Aurelia is attacked by the neighboring country of Leasath, lead by Diego Gaspar Navarro. They invaded because Aurelia was supposedly involved with aiding their enemies in the civil war.

There's a variety of crafts with different paint schemes to choose from and many battle missions to attend. In the campaign mode (as usual with different paths to complete it), players can unlock parts to tune their planes. Money is earned by destroying enemies and completing objectives. There are 17 missions in total, but the quickest route in the campaign mode can be done in 10.

There is a new multiplayer mode: now up to 4 players can take up one mission in a cooperative (2 players against 2 AI-controlled fighters) or the versus mode with different game types such as Dogfight-Survival, Dog Fight-Shoot Out, Base Attack, Air Superiority, Beacon Battle and Escort Mission.</Overview>

    <Name>Ace Combat: Joint Assault</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2010-09-24T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Ace Combat: Joint Assault leaves the fictional worlds of previous Ace Combat installments and enters the real world. The missions take place over London, Tokyo and San Francisco, but still feature fictional elements like huge flying fortresses. The player takes the role of a young pilot who joins the private military force Martinez Security and soon has to fight the Valahia, some sort of bandits which threaten whole cities - but of course the plot soon becomes more complicated.

The gameplay is mostly identical to the PSP predecessor Ace Combat X: Skies of Deception. The player controls combat airplanes (either in third-person or from a cockpit view) and fights other airplanes (or other big flying enemies) while dodging their missiles. After finishing missions, which mostly consist of killing a certain number of enemies or boss fights, the player receives money which is reinvested into unlocking more airplanes or upgrades. These aircraft are based (and licensed from) real-life models and have certain advantages and disadvantages, e.g. some are more suitable against flying enemies while bombers are effective against ground targets. The mission tree is branching and the player has to choose between multiple missions at times.

The only major new features are the "enhanced combat view" (because modern air combat is usually fought over long distances, the game zooms in to give a nearer visual look at the enemies) and the co-op mode which allows to play the whole campaign with other players. Then the game takes advantage of the branching missions, meaning that the (up to four) players are divided into two teams. The other multiplayer modes are identical to Skies of Deception, except that they allow eight instead of four players to participate.</Overview>

    <Name>Activision Hits Remixed</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2006-11-14T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The PSP version of Activision Anthology is a compilation of 44 classic Atari 2600 titles. On top of that, it includes an eighties soundtrack with 10 licensed songs to pull you back into that era.

Unlike the GBA version, it contains the Imagic titles from the console and PC/Mac releases (Atlantis, Demon Attack, and Moonsweeper), along with more music, but not the homebrew titles as offered in the GBA and PC/Mac release.

In the media section, you can view the original cartridge in 3D, as well as the manual. Games can be played in the original aspect ratios (windowed in the middle of the screen), or stretched for a full-screen view. The game supports game sharing so two players can play with a single copy through an Ad Hoc network. There are different difficulty levels and you can save the game state to continue playing later. High scores are recorded and you can unlock achievements such as original gamer patches and vintage TV commercials.

    <ReleaseDate>2005-06-30T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Adventure Player Studio FromSoftware is actually not a game in the classic sense of the word. This is a programming program that allows PSP users to create and exchange their own games.

To take full advantage of the software's capabilities, two components are required: Adventure Player UMD Software and Memory Stick Duo. The software is sold together with three ready-made games (one of them is Echo Night - a title released by From Software on PlayStation in 1998).

This program is designed to create games such as Play Novel, which are very popular in the Far East, where you can read a lot of dialogues and choose from text, while watching static graphics in the background. These are not the only possibilities - you can easily try to create a puzzle game or some kind of quiz. Players can exchange their works through the possibility of a direct connection to the console or via the Internet.</Overview>

    <Name>After Burner: Black Falcon</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2007-03-20T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>After Burner: Black Falcon is the fourth game in the After Burner series, released almost fifteen years after the previous game. Just like the earlier ones it is an action based flying game, shown from a third-person perspective. Familiar characteristics are the fast pace, taking on many enemies at once with a combination of hit-scan and lock-on weapons, and evasive manoeuvres through rolls.

The game consists of 24 levels. Players choose from three pilots (Billy Blaze, Harrison Duke and Tomiko Rossellini) to go after the terrorist cell Black Falcon that has stolen thirteen prototype planes. Each pilot brings along different plot twists and there are nineteen different planes to fly (mostly jets). They can be equipped with weapons and items, or be given a paint job. The game takes place on locations all over the world and while flying there are often short sequences by the pilots. There are also many objects in the scenery that need to be avoided or destroyed. Missions have main objectives and side missions that brings along more money for upgrades. As usual, there are large bosses that wield weapons such as EMP.

Multiplayer is supported for eight players, in competitive modes and a two-player cooperative mode.</Overview>

    <Name>AKB 48 no 1 Idol to Koi shitara</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2010-12-23T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>AKB1/48: Idol to Koishitara... is a romance adventure game featuring all the girls from AKB48 pop idol group. The story begins in a dreamlike situation where all the girls are in love with you, but in the end, you will have to choose only one. AKB48 (AKB is abbreviation of Akihabara, an electronic town in Tokyo) is a j-pop idol group with 48 members in total. Members aren't constant and their popularity is based on votes by the fans of the group. This is the first game in the series and takes place in Tokyo (background images during visual-novel style gameplay are photos from various known locations in Tokyo).

The game mostly plays like a visual novel which features real-life locations and actual idols in various poses over the background image instead of anime art. The game progresses one day at the time where you spend with one of the idols, either on a date or in casual talk. The player is given a list of letters sent to you by AKB48 girls with their profiles. Based on who sent you the message, you can reply to it which eventually leads you to a date with that person. You can use the phone to call the person of interest and set a date. During the date part which plays as a visual novel, there will be a dialogue selection which will show the girl you're with if you're rude, indifferent or like her. This in turn may prompt her to contact you again at the beginning of the next day. Some correspondence occurs irregularly when the girl liked how she felt when she was with you on previous dates. Likewise, addresses of the girls you were rude with will disappear from the list until only one remains. Initially, all 48 girls are listed as your potential girlfriends. During special so called escort event scenes, idols will wear a special outfit just for you. Any event scene during visual novel gameplay lets on-screen text be toggled off and allows for certain amount of zooming.

Various unlockables such as visual cards, event scenes, and steel photos can accessed from the menu, while collected cards can be traded with other players. AKB48 soundtrack does not need to be unlocked and can be listened via BGM player. It additionally lets the player select default BGM song and theme song for each of the ABK48 members. Voice-acting for each of the AKB48 girls in the game is done by AKB48 members.</Overview>

AKB48 (AKB is abbreviation of Akihabara, an electronic town in Tokyo) is a j-pop idol group with, yes, you guessed it, 48 members in total. Members aren't constant and their popularity is based on votes by the fans of the group. As the title implies, the game takes place in the island of Guam, and idols will wear bikinis a lot, and regular clothes lot less.

The game mostly plays like a visual novel which user real-life locations and actual idols in various poses over the background image instead of anime art. The setting itself is not the only thing differing from the first game. This game features new poses and photo shots with different clothes (the more showing kind) and re-recorded voice-acting by AKB48 members for the new scenario. The game progresses one day at the time where you spend with one of the idols, either on a date or in casual talk. The player is given a list of letters sent to you by AKB48 girls with their profiles. Based on who sent you the message, you can reply to it which eventually leads you to a date with that person. You can use the phone to call the person of interest and set a date.

    <Name>Alien Syndrome</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2007-07-24T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Alien Syndrome is a top down shooter inspired by Sega's original Alien Syndrome action game. The games story takes place thousands of years in the future; by this point in time mankind has explored many parts of the galaxy and established numerous colonies. One such colony, Seti-Alpha 5 (SAT5), has ceased communications for some reason and it is your job to head to SAT5 and investigate what went wrong. Upon arrival, you encounter the alien syndrome, a force which can mutate man and machine into deadly aliens. These events take place roughly 100 years after those in the original Alien Syndrome.

When you begin the game you can select one of several characters as well as choose a character specialty (such as demolitions expert, firebug, seal, tank, and sharpshooter). The specialty you select will determine your initial character stats; as you play through the game you earn levels which provide you points to allocate towards improving your stats. The character stats help determine your characters accuracy in ranged or close attacks, speed, healing power, resistance to fire/radiation, armor strength, and so on.

Similar to the original game, the action is viewed top down. You'll need to explore the numerous corridors and rooms found on SAT5 and eliminate the numerous alien invaders found there. Mission objectives are often provided to you which need to be completed. Additional weapons, ammo, and other useful items can be found throughout the levels. Your character has a limited amount of energy, and if all energy is lost then you will need to begin again at the last checkpoint crossed.</Overview>

    <Name>Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2007-11-13T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Aliens Vs Predator: Requiem is based on the movie of the same name and continues the mix of the Aliens and Predator franchises. The basic premise of the movie is followed. Picking up where the original film left off, a group of predators travels back to the homeworld with a predalien, a survivor impregnated with an alien embryo. In a struggle to kill the creature that possesses the strengths and weaknesses of both species, the ship crashes on earth. A father and a son who investigate the vessel are impregnated by facehuggers allowing the aliens to continue their colonization of the planet. When a lone predator scout discovers the ship has crashed, he travels to earth to rid it of the intruders.

Players take control of the predator from a third-person perspective. While the humans and aliens are fighting, his main task is to dissolve and disintegrate all evidence of extraterrestrial life. During the course of the game, the aliens are the main enemies, but humans will also engage the predator when he is sighted. The predator can activate a cloak, but this drains energy so it needs to be recharged every now and then by returning to the normal mode. The cloak automatically disappears when in contact with water. He also has three vision modes (tech, thermal and alien) to get a better look of the environment. Enemies can be locked to make it easier to track them while they are moving.

The shoulder buttons control the camera while the analogue stick is used to run around. Next to basic wrist attacks he also has additional weapons such as a shoulder cannon, hand cannon and a disc that can be thrown. The available weapons can be selected before starting a mission. These can be upgraded after completing missions. He can also zoom in (switching to a first-person mode) and tag aliens to earn honour points. These can be used to upgrade weapons and are also awarded when no humans are killed. Basic movement includes jumping, breaking through walls, climbing and shaking off aliens when pinned down as well. To progress, a certain amount of evidence usually needs to be removed first. The game offers branched missions paths with entirely different settings. While playing, a map can be activated to shown the environment, enemies and objectives.

Next to the main storyline, there are skirmish matches that can be played with two players cooperatively as well.</Overview>

    <Name>All Kamen Rider: Rider Generation 2</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2012-08-02T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>All Kamen Rider: Rider Generation 2 is the 2012 sequel to the original Rider Generation for the Nintendo DS, expanding on nearly every facet of the original - the playable stable of Kamen Riders has increased dramatically, older characters have expanded capabilities and movesets, and the game itself was simultaneously released for the DS and Playstation Portable.

Just like its predecessor, Rider Generation 2 combines 2D side-scrolling beat-em-up action with stock RPG elements, with each Rider having individual EXP counts and stat training parameters. While the basic structure of a human-played Rider and AI partner remains, Rider Generation 2 also features 2-player functionality via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection or the PSP's Ad Hoc wireless.

The password system from Rider Generation 1 has been completely revamped for RG2: instead of unlocking additional stages for each world (and an "incomplete" Kamen Rider Fourze), the new, simpler passwords enable players to instantly unlock nearly any Rider in the playable list, negating the wait to mow down tokusatsu villains with fan/personal favorites - whether your favorite may be the massively overhauled Fourze, the classic Rider-1, the poorly-treated-by-America Black RX, the sole female entrant Kiva-la, the currently-airing (and existing in a prototypical state) Wizard, or another Rider entirely.</Overview>

    <Overview>Ririko Takeuchi is a female P.I. who got into the career more by chance than by choice. Her father, Takeo Takeuchi, is an ex-cop who bought an old kindergarten and made it into a private investigation firm. Depending on the cases, players, in the role of Ririko, will be tailing suspects, searching for clues, and, having what's most important for any investigator, a bunch of internal monologues.

Anata o Yurusanai is a visual novel (also described as "sound novel"), which mainly consists of reading text and occasionally interacting with the development of the story. The game uses the PSP in a way it wasn't meant to be used, vertically, making the visuals resemble a comic book.</Overview>

    <Overview>Ape Escape Academy sees you taking on the role of one of the cheeky monkeys from the Ape Escape series. Choose your chimp, then prepare to tackle various classes in Academy Mode. Each 'class' is actually a mini-game. Your goal is to complete as many mini-games as possible from the 9x9 grid, and score as many lines as you can (sort of like Noughts and Crosses). Mini-games range from mind-bending quizzes to wacky sports games, to the just plain silly, like protecting a roast banana from oncoming apes, or flying through the sky delivering parachutes to plummeting primates.

As you unlock games in Academy Mode, you can begin to play them in the "Mini-game Collection". Here, you can choose from available mini-games, and play them as you wish to become better at them. Some mini-games also have hidden statues in them - grab these to unlock more monkey profiles in your Showcase. Finally, you can also choose to play Ape Escape Academy against up to three friends as you fight to find out who's the best.</Overview>

    <Overview>Downstream Panic! is a colourful puzzle game that mixes elements from LocoRoco with Worms.

A massive cyclone has sucked all of the fish out of the oceans! The player must safely guide them back. Levels start at the top of the area where the fish are contained in a blob of water. They need to reach the ocean safely at the bottom of the screen with guidance of the player.

Using a variety of creative tools like fans, onions, rockets, and cloud factories, the fish can be guided through platforms, past hungry sharks, piranhas and many other dangers. The tools can also be used to control the flow of the water and the direction the fish travel. Plants will stop the flow and by blowing flowers bridges are opened. At the start of the level, the area usually needs to be scanned first using the free camera perspective to discover all the hazards. Certain fish can be sacrificed, but a sufficient number of them needs to reach the ocean.

The regular mode eventually unlocks the Free Play and Survival modes. In Free Play the player can spend the money from regular games to buy tools for the stages. In survival all levels are replayed in succession, but lost fish are not regained in the next level.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2010-05-04T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>In the wake of the now defunct Navis's failed attempt to control recovered ancient weapons technology, the world has been left in tatters. Looking to consolidate power, the Corporations (Crest, Mirage, and Kisaragi) have merged into one super-corporation known as "The Alliance". Fed up with corporate rule and oppression, and seeing a newfound threat in The Alliance, a Raven known as Jack-O (an important but minor character from Armored Core: Nexus) forms an organization of Ravens known as "Vertex" from the ashes of the fallen Raven's Ark. After rallying a sizable force of fellow Ravens to his cause, Jack-O declares that he will launch an all-out war on the Alliance in 24 hours. Leading the opposing force, a Raven named Evangel has rallied just as many Ravens to the Alliance and is preparing to fight Jack-O head on. Making matters all the more complicated, many Ravens have turned into independent warlords, setting out on their own after the collapse of Raven's Ark.

To finish this volatile situation: you. You are approached by both sides seeking your cooperation. Will you side with the Corporations, or assist Vertex in causing their downfall? You have a choice to make, Raven.</Overview>

    <Overview>Yuri Sakazaki has been kidnapped! Her big brother Ryo Sakazaki and Robert Garcia, his best friend, go search for her on the streets of South Town. As they go deeper and deeper they will find clues as to who ordered the kidnapping, the Sakazaki family's relation to the mob, and a person from their past.

The gameplay differs from most fighting games. In this game, you have a Spirit meter. A Spirit meter is in the game and will decrease as you perform special moves. It can be recharged, but doing so leaves you open to attack. When your health is almost gone, you can perform a secret combination that will unleash a deadly attack on your opponent - provided you have a full Spirit meter.

The arcade version doesn't allow you to play as Mr. Big and the elusive Mr. Karate.</Overview>

    <Name>Asphalt: Urban GT 2</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2007-03-22T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The sequel to Asphalt: Urban GT continues the fast-paced racing of the original game with various additions. Races take place on eight locations all over the world. While racing, smashing other cars, or avoiding the police, there is cash to collect. Money becomes available by risky driving, wiping out opponents or cops, or by picking up items. When a certain cash level is reached, new elements are opened up, such as parts to tune the car (for free), new tracks, new vehicles, or a new game mode. For the first time in the series, bikes are also available.

While racing, a boost meter can be built up by picking up specific items or taking out other cars. A double boost can be applied for high speeds, while a double tap to the right or the left makes the car drift. By ignoring all driving regulations, a wanted meter slowly builds up. The cops will chase with regular patrol cars, helicopters, or they will set up a road block.

The game offers 4 modes:

    Evolution: race for the first place.

    Duel: race against a single opponent, with a bet. The higher the prize, the tougher the cops are.

    Beat 'Em All: win the race by wiping out all opponents before the finish line is reached.

    Cop Chase: play as patrol car and wipe out all illegal racers.

The game's theme song is a digitized version of Moby's Lift Me Up (which is also the intro music for UK TV's Formula One racing coverage) and the girls of the pop group The Pussycat Dolls make an appearance before and after each race.</Overview>

    <Name>Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-11-17T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Assassin's Creed: Bloodlines is a PSP-exclusive game that continues the story of the first Assassin's Creed game and also builds up to its sequel Assassin's Creed II. Unlike the Assassin's Creed: Altaïr's Chronicles spin-off for mobile and portable devices, it offers the open world and nonlinear gameplay of the original game.

The game is set one month after the events of the first game and takes place in the two cities Limassol and Kyrenia on the island of Cyprus. The Templars have moved there and Altaïr has followed them to find out what their plans are and to take all of them out if there is an opportunity. The main villain is Armand Bouchart, grand master of the Templars, who is hunting the apple of Eden, which will allow him to control the minds of anyone he chooses.

Gameplay runs on similar vein to the original Assasin's Creed. Altaïr has the ability move freely through each of the cities in the familiar parkour style based on stealth and sneaking up on targets. Players can also opt to have Altaïr simply fight his way in at street level and go in through the front door. Altaïr's arsenal consists of his fists for melee (usually non-lethal) combat, his signature sleeve sword and a longsword.

Bloodlines also features PS3 connectivity via USB, which allows you to unlock six new weapons in Assasin's Creed II when your PSP is hooked up to your PS3. These can also be used in the PSP version. In addition to this, any Templar coins you find in Bloodlines are carried over to Assassin's Creed II, and codex pages will give you a health boost.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2006-11-17T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Several druids are kidnapped by the Romans and it seems that Getafix has something to do with it. Asterix &amp; Obelix travel to Rome only to find out that Caesar has built a huge amusement park called "Las Vegum" in which he holds the druids captive.

Asterix &amp; Obelix need to fight their way through countless Roman soldiers in order to find and free the druids hidden in the different themed areas of the park. On their way they team up or fight against several game-inspired NPCs like Sam Shieffer or Larry Craft. To fight foes the characters have several attack combos and special items like the famous magic potion at their disposal.

There are also some puzzles, for which you often need to switch between both characters (which you can do at any time) in order to solve them. Asterix, for instance, cannot move a heavy stone out of the way.

The PSP version adds a multiplayer mode: up to four players can play team and objective-based missions, with one team having to complete an objective (like collecting herbs, defending the village, stealing magic potion), the other having to prevent it. AI-controlled team mates join in if not enough players are available.</Overview>

    <Name>ATV Offroad Fury Pro</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2006-10-26T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>ATV Offroad Fury Pro is an offroad racing game which was released alongside with ATV Offroad Fury 4. Besides the expected ATV (all-terrain vehicles) there are also a variety of other vehicles to race with, e.g. trucks or bikes, which is the foundation of the career mode: participating in a string of championships which are divided in vehicle type and difficulty. Upgrades and additional vehicles are purchased with credits which can be earned in a number of ways: besides price money for winning races, credits are also awarded for performing stunts. There are also three sponsors which offer free upgrades and/or credits for fulfilling their demands regarding performance and stunt rating, but they should be hired with caution because a big penalty is assigned for missed goals. The available types of races are Supercross, Rallycross, National, Freestyle, Circuit, Endurcross, Rally and Snowcross.

Besides a basic course editor and multiplayer for up to four players (which is also the maximum number of racers in single-player) there are also connectivity features with ATV Offroad Fury 4 which allow to exchange courses/vehicles and access a shared online community.</Overview>

    <Name>Avatar: The Last Airbender</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2006-10-10T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Based on the animated television program of the same name, Avatar: The Last Airbender follows the adventures of a group of kids living in an Asian-inspired fantasy world where the nations have been divided up according to the four classical elements: Air, Water, Earth, and Fire. Within each nation are people who can control that one element, known as benders. The Avatar is a person who can control all four elements, and is charged with keeping peace between the four nations. However, 100 years previous the Avatar had disappeared, making it possible for the Fire Nation to wage a war of conquest across the world. As the show begins, the new Avatar, Aang (originally an Airbender, hence the title of the series), has been found, and now he must travel the world, learning how to bend all four elements and fighting against the Fire Nation alongside his friends Katara (a Waterbender of the Water Tribe) and Sokka (her older brother).

In the game, the player may choose one of four characters: Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Haru (an Earthbender). Each character's fighting style and abilities are unique, and new abilities can be gained as they earn experience by defeating enemies. Items are also available to assist the player, such as armor, chi, accessories, and healing potions. As an action/adventure game, the gameplay is viewed from top-down perspective, with the player battling enemies and searching for specific items required the complete the quests necessary to progress further into the game. The story unfolds over several chapters, and players cannot return to previous areas.

Set between the first and second seasons of the show, the game follows Aang and friends as they investigate the disappearance of a young Waterbender, and find themselves in pursuit of an inventor named Lian the Maker, who has been forced to create dangerous machines for the Fire Nation. As they travel between the Water Tribe and Earth Kingdom, the characters battle Fire Nation soldiers, strange animals, and various machines. Some other characters from the world of Avatar also make minor appearances in the game, including Prince Zuko, who appears during cut scenes only.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2009-03-19T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>In face of human technological advancement during the Meiji Restoration, the youkai of Japan were forced to make a hard decision:
1) To remain as youkai and watch over the land
2) To return to the netherworld
3) To give up their power and status as youkai and live amongst humans.

While there were some that chose otherwise, the majority of the youkai decided it was best to become human. It was tough, but as time passed these youkai were able to blend in with the human world and live peacefully amongst them.

However, blood is thicker than water. The offspring of these youkai displayed the powerful abilities of their ancestors in times of great anxiety, often manifesting in horrible and dangerous ways, and were labeled by society as monsters.
Officially their condition was named "Acquired Systemic Special Heredity variety Syndrome", or "ASSHS" for short and treated as a non-contagious illness, but the common people began to refer to them as Jinyous (half-youkai) nevertheless.

Of these Jinyous, most were sent to Kamizawa City: an isolated urban area walled off from the rest of Japan to keep all the Jinyous together and away from the human population. However, the ones that were deemed especially dangerous were sent to a medical facility on an uncharted island near the shores of Japan where they would be under constant surveillance.

Takabe Ryouichi was one of those who were sent to said island at the age of five. This is a story about him along with the girl called Suzu, his only friend on the island, escaping to Kamizawa city to live a normal life. What they didn’t expect was that Suzu carried a secret that attracted much unwanted attention…</Overview>

    <Overview>The game focusses on an original protagonist, Seiya, who attends the same school as Toppa Bashin and comes in possession of a cornerstone. Meanwhile, J returns to Japan, to show off a new Battle system and somehow, Dan was transported from Otherworld to Toppa's world. 

In this game, Battle Spirits is not played according to the card game rules. Instead, players appear on a round field, where they can battle alongside their spirits. Some spirits can be summoned to the field (where both spirits and the players themselves are vulnerable to their attacks), while others provide field effects or can just be used for a single attack. Magic cards are also playable for support, and nexus cards act as invisible traps.

The opposite of the game is to bring your opponent's health to zero.

To gain more cards, you must earn money through battle, and use the towers in the Battle Spirits center. Some promo cards are also available via passwords.</Overview>

    <Overview>Bleach: Heat The Soul 3 is the third installment in the Heat the Soul series, released on July 20, 2006.The game features 34 characters, covering events from the Soul Society: The Sneak Entry arc to Ulquiorra Schiffer's introduction at the beginning of The Arrancar arc. Unique to Heat the Soul 3 are "Soul Road" and "Karakura Heroes." In Soul Road, the player is to select the desired character and partner character. Afterwards, the player is set on a board game-like map where the goal is to pass through markers in order to fight enemies. After each match, the player is given an amount of "Trust points" (how many received depends on the mode's difficulty) which go towards leveling up partner characters and unlocking bonuses, such as alternate costumes and new partners. To unlock these bonuses, the player must find a blue marker to turn in their points; however, before doing so, the player must answer a multiple choice question. In Karakura Heroes, the player is put into a humorous side-story, with some extra anime scenes added.

The system also includes specials which use the tagged partner's abilities.

The game features 32 characters usable in Tag Battle mode, while extra characters can be obtained with Bleach: Heat The Soul 4 game save through game conversion. However, these characters are only usable in single mode with no in-game transformation. They are selected through a separate menu accessible by pressing L/R in the normal character menu.</Overview>

    <Name>Bomberman: Bakufuu Sentai Bombermen</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2006-03-09T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Bakufū Sentai Bombermen is one of the many, many titles in Hudson's long-running bomb-blasting action series. Taking the reverse approach compared to Bomberman: Act Zero's dark, gritty rework, it reimagines Bomberman as a team of brightly-colored Power Rangers-style bomb-dropping crime-fighting sentai superheroes. The original 8-bit Bomberman also appears in full pixelated 3D glory.

The game itself plays much like any other Bomberman game: Drop bombs to trap and destroy enemies, blow up crates for power-up items, avoid the various hazards on each stage, and try not to get blown up yourself. The story mode sees each member of the Bombermen team play first through several Classic stages as their blocky retro equivalent to regain their powers, then on to more dangerous Arrange stages as their sentai hero form. In Arrange modes, each Bomber has their own unique abilities: Pink Bomber, for example, can jump over blocks and other hazards with proper timing.

The other single-player mode is Challenge mode. This mode is a timed race to score as many points as possible over multiple stages within a strict time limit. There is, of course, also wifi multiplayer for up to five players, and even minigames that can be played by linking with I.Q Mania and XI Coliseum. Also included are demo versions of both of these titles.</Overview>

    <Name>Bomberman: Panic Bomber</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2005-06-23T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>It is a "falling blocks" puzzle game based on the Bomberman franchise. The goal of the game is essentially to cause your opponent to lose by causing their gameplay field to fill to the top with objects. You do this by causing chains of bombs to explode, sending useless rubble over to your opponent's field, which they must then remove themselves. Bombs are earned by causing chains of three identical blocks to disappear. Bombs can only be blown up with an explosion from a lit bomb, which falls from the top of the screen every so often. If the player causes enough damage, they can eventually earn a giant bomb, which will remove a large amount of debris from the playing field, and cause their opponent a good deal of trouble.

The game's regular story mode revolves around Bomberman's hunt for the Golden Bomber statue. During his trek, he fights against several different odd characters, like Drifty the balloon, or Cecil the tiger. However, all that can really be earned from playing through this mode is a harder difficulty level, earned by finishing the entire story at the "hard" difficulty level. The player's progress is saved by a password system.</Overview>

    <Overview>Brian Lara 2007: Pressure Play is the first PSP incarnation of the Codemasters series of Brian Lara cricket games. It has simple controls and an arcade feel.

Later Pressure Plays involve famous run chases, holding out for rain, and hitting six sixes off an over.

The game supports ad-hoc PSP multiplayer for 2 players, but does not support game sharing. Additionally, the game focuses exclusively on one-day internationals, with no option to play tests, 20-20s, or county cricket.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2007-08-21T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Brunswick Pro Bowling is a bowling simulation game. In Career mode, after creating an avatar, players compete against the computer to work their way up from amateur to professional. The player character will increase in skill (e.g. strength, accuracy) and earn money while playing. This money can be used to buy clothing or a new bowling ball, which also affects skill. Quick Play mode, as the name suggests, allows for a quick round of bowling for one to four players.

Making a throw is a little bit different depending on the platform the game is played on. Lining up on the alley to decide the direction of the ball stays the same, but on PlayStation 2 and PSP it's also necessary to set its spin. The next step is rolling the ball. On the Wii this is done by swinging the Wiimote and releasing the trigger button, where the speed of the release determines the spin of the ball. In the other versions a sickle-shaped meter is shown; pulling down on the analog stick sets the accuracy, and pushing it forward the strength of the release.</Overview>

    <Overview>Mito Aoi is a normal high school student living in a shrine with her childhood friend, Kaminari Sousuke. One day her mother asks them to clean their warehouse, where they find a silver mirror among the other antique stuff. Just before they go out, a thunder strikes outside and Aoi gets absorbed into the mirror. When she opens her eyes Aoi finds herself back in 1873, the Meiji era.. and in front of her is a group of travelling performers, Aoiza.
Aoi immediately notices an older Sousuke in the group, but he introduces herself as Kaminari Kensuke and tells her she’s got the wrong person. For some reason the group also keeps calling her “Futaba Aoi”, making her even more confused. She follows Aoiza back to their headquarter, a shop called Miyoshino in Ueno, where she finally learns that “Futaba Aoi” is actually a sacred stone they’ve been protecting all this time. It’s a family crest with a strong magical power, but nobody knows of its existence except for Aoiza’s members. Today the stone suddenly disappeared from its box, and they finally found it on Aoi’s wrist. Because of this, they now think she’s the embodiment of “Futaba Aoi” itself.
As for Aoi herself, she was born holding that stone. Her grandma said it might bring good luck to her someday, so Aoi keeps it with her all the time. Who would have thought that it’s going to play an important role in the past? The Aoiza members then asks her to stay with them, since she doesn’t know anything about this world. Plus, it would be easier for them to protect the stone as well. Aoi gladly takes their offer, and it marks the start of her journey with them.</Overview>

    <Overview>Bump 'N' Jump is an action racing game played from a top down point of view. As you race through the treacherous and ever changing roadways, the numerous enemy cars will be trying to bump you off the road. You need to make sure you bump the cars out of the way before you get bumped and crash into the sides yourself! Your car also has the ability to jump quite high if you have enough speed. This is useful to jump over enemy cars if there are too many in the way, and must also be used to jump gaps in the roadway and other highway obstacles. As the levels progress, the road becomes narrower with more obstacles in the way, and the other cars increase in number and in aggressiveness.</Overview>

    <Overview>Burnout Dominator is an installment of the Burnout series for the PlayStation 2 and the PlayStation Portable systems. The game is mainly focused on returned Burnouts feature - draining a complete boost meter without stopping wich was last seen in Burnout 2: Point of Impact. With return of Burnouts feature there were four new game modes added including Maniac Mode (players need to drive dangerously to get highest scores by earning drifts, air, oncoming and near misses. Chaining Burnouts in this mode increases the score multiplier), Drift Challenge (in this mode player need to obtain as many feet of drifting as possible. Chaining Burnouts also increases the score multiplier here), Near Miss Challenge (same as Drift Challenge, but player needs to score near miss bonuses), Burnout Challenge (also same as Drift Challenge, but focusing on obtaining Burnouts score). However, some options have been removed from the game - for instance Burnout Dominator doesn't feature Crash Mode, there is also no Traffic Checking Mode and Online Multiplayer. But PSP version features Burnout HQ where you can upload you score and download new track. The game consists of 12 different tracks, in 8 different real world locations. Each track has a forward and a reverse configuration.</Overview>

    <Overview>Bust-a-Move Deluxe is the second game in the franchise to appear on the PSP. True to the classic puzzle gameplay, players launch bubbles of different colours from the bottom of the screen to match at least three like colours to clear parts of the field before it is forced down. This version offers 300 puzzles in the Classic mode and adds some new modes.

In the Ghost mode, bubbles pass through any objects until they hit and wall, and then stick to another orb. If you fail to clear a set of bubbles, a heart meter increases. When it reaches five, the game is over. Clear plenty of bubbles and a ghost will appear on the opponent's screen, masking the colours. There are also 8 Challenge Puzzle modes, with six rounds each, adding extra strategy through balancing the board, hiding colours for a while, a cannon placed on a horizontally-moving conveyor belt, varying colours, single-shot puzzles, distorted time and speed, or a focus on skill shots by playing for points. Multiplayer is also supported.

Next to the known characters Bub, Bob, Monsta and Dorank, 6 new playable characters include Goon, Chick'n, Banebow and Propella and unlockables.</Overview>

    <Overview>Buzz!: Brain of the UK is a general knowledge quiz game about the United Kingdom in the long-running Buzz series.

It is part of the global Buzz!: Brain of the World brand with 21 different versions for specific countries, such as Buzz!: Brain of Oz for Australia.

In addition to that localized content, Brain of the UK also retains the MyBuzz feature which enables users to create custom quizzes. All quiz packs bought on previous Buzz games are also playable in this version.

The PlayStation 3 version features online play and allows users access to user created questions on the My Buzz! site as well as leaderboards that rank online play.

The PSP version contains a single player game and includes the "pass-around" mode from the previous PSP titles in the series to enable up to 6 players to take part in the same quiz.</Overview>

The patched Facebook features allow players to post details of the game session just played, including the in-game names of those who took part, and who won.</Overview>

    <Name>Cabela's Dangerous Hunts: Ultimate Challenge</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2006-04-04T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Cabela's Dangerous Hunts: Ultimate Challenge is largely a conversion of the 2003 console game Cabela's Dangerous Hunt with a few control options to make it more accessible for a hand-held device.

As a hunting simulator, it is largely action oriented. In the main story mode the player needs to rescue an old friend who has gone missing. Before that, several short missions in different environments need to be played, ranging from forest to open fields and snowy landscapes. Players are usually accompanied by an AI character with short cut-scenes that advance the story. Most missions require the player to explore the terrain, getting past obstacles (e.g. swimming through a river when a bridge breaks down) and shooting every animal that comes in sight.

Shown from a first-person perspective, players can move and look around freely, strafe, aim, zoom and slow down time for a moment to get a better shot. Targets are highlighted in red when the cursor passes over them. The arsenal includes everything from small handguns to heavy rifles. They have limited ammo and need to be reloaded regularly. On the terrain additional ammunition and medikits can be found. When animals attack or get too close, there is a secondary attack where the player uses his weapon to push animals away. The species include rabbits, lions, wolves, bears and more.

Next to the main Story mode, Quick Action offers short games in different settings. From a fixed position, players need to take out animals or practice targets with a limited amount of time. In one of these even dinosaurs get hunted from inside a helicopter.</Overview>

    <Name>Cars 2</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-11-08T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Disney•Pixar Cars 2 is a racing game based on the animated movie of the same name. The frame story is that Lightning McQueen and his friends are trained in C.H.R.O.M.E. missions, the races, in order to defeat Professor Zundapp. 

The main racing event is battle mode in which the player races against opponents and collects power-ups on the way which either allow to perform offensive (machine guns) or defensive (e.g. a shield against enemy attacks) actions as well as speed boosts. There are various other variants of battle mode, including racing against the clock or elimination races. In contrast to the console/PC version, the cars are not freely controlled: the player can only jump between the lanes. The camera angle changes automatically during the race.

During the campaign the player will unlock a number of additional cars which differ in their control, power and speed ratings. Before tackling a new campaign mission, which have different difficulty levels assigned to them, the used car can be changed. The free play mode allows to choose between all racing modes.</Overview>

    <Overview>Cars: Race-O-Rama is a racing game set in the Disney/Pixar Cars universe. It is the third entry in a series of THQ licensed games that include Cars and Cars: Mater-National Championship . The game includes a single-player story mode and an arcade mode. In story mode, you progress through a series of races and mini-games with a series of cutscenes. In arcade mode, you can replay story mode events and compete in 2-player split-screen races. The plot of Cars: Race-O-Rama centers around Lightning McQueen as he trains students of the Doc Hudson Racing Academy to compete in the Race-O-Rama Circuit. Soon, Lightning discovers that his arch-enemy, Chick Hicks, is training a rival group of racers who don't race by the rules. Lightning must compete against these rival racers in an effort to win the Race-O-Rama trophy. Story mode uses an open-world format, where you can explore the world and play different events by driving to marked waypoints. There are 7 different main explorable areas including Radiator Springs Stadium, Ornament Valley, Tailfin Pass, Radiator Springs, Santa Carburera, Autovia, and Motoropolis. There are also 3 mini-games based on the Disney/Pixar animated short series "Cars Toons" that center around the character Mater. These include "Mater the Greater", "El Materdor", and "Tokyo Mater". While racing, there is a boost meter that slowly fills over time. Using the boost will give you a quick speed increase. There is also a new drifting mechanic that allows you to take tighter turns and fill the boost meter more rapidly. You can also jump in most races to avoid obstacles and other racers.</Overview>

    <Name>Chili Con Carnage</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2007-02-27T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Chili Con Carnage is a semi-sequel to the PS2 game Total Overdose - the Latin-style action game by the same developer. The game recycles a lot of the levels and assets from the PS2 version, but it has new missions and a structure fine-tuned for handheld play. While the original game is a free-roaming GTA clone, the PSP version consists of a series of short missions. It focuses on the shooting sequences of Total Overdose where Ramiro uses his flashiest moves to dispatch mobs and fiends.

The main story mode, El Gringo Loco is identical to Total Overdose. The player takes on the role of Ramiro Cruz, a young man who has just witnessed his dad's murder in classic Mexican fashion «combine harvester through office wall», and now he is on a gun-fueled quest for vengeance through Mexico. The second single player mode El Macho is a collection of different mini challenges which do not tell any story but give access to different characters with different gameplay. The game also future two dynamic multiplayer modes: Hangman for up to 4 players on 1 console and Fiesta for Wi-Fi gameplay.

There is a massive amount of exotic weapons and the gameplay is over the top, with bullet-time and gravity-defying moves.</Overview>

    <Overview>After the defeat of the evil Emperor Body, it seemed like peace may finally return to the Builder star system. However, a new force has begun to drain the Protien from the planets here: Emperor Body the Second. Idaten and Benten, having defeated Body before, immediately set off to destroy the plant that's draining the Protein, and defeat evil once and for all.

Zero Chō Aniki is a side-scrolling shooter from the infamously bizarre Chō Aniki series. Controlling either Idaten or Benten and their options, the player must survive five stages filled with curiously suggestive enemies and environments. Destroying enemies will earn power-ups to increase the player's output, and there are also bombs and the special "Men's Beam" which can help clear the screen if things get overwhelmingly hectic. There are two difficulty settings on offer, and in addition to the main mode, there is also a boss rush mode unlocked after clearing the game.</Overview>

    <Overview>Why did they appear? What were they created for? The answer still eludes us. What we do know, is that the mysterious labyrinths appeared
decades ago, and with them, the world was changed forever. Their true form unknown and ever-changing, they sprawl across the world like a web, connecting towns and villages, mountains, lakes, and deserts. 

Many adventurers delved into these labyrinths dreaming of riches, and those fortunate enough to return did so with tales and treasures untold. It was only natural that the children of our world began to look upon these heroes with their unconditional admiration. And as they say, imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. 

Here at our campus, we strive to equip young men and women with the tools they’ll need to become full-fledged adventurers. To all the bright-eyed students stepping through our gates for their first term: Welcome. We hope your studies here are as enriching and productive as you’ve dreamed they would be.

    <ReleaseDate>2007-09-18T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Coded Arms: Contagion is a direct sequel to the Coded Arms game, and the second game in the series. The player takes on the role of special agent Jacob Grant and enters a virtual reality combat simulation program called A.I.D.A to stabilise it and enable its proper use. After the simulation program previously spread through earth's networks and ran loose, humans had to risk their lives by digitizing their personality, for a chance to hack inside the system and bring back the valuable data inside, guarded by enemies from the military program that was no longer in use. Now that it is contained again, while experimenting Jacob discovers that the program is still not stable.

Like its predecessor, Coded Arms: Contagion is a first-person shooter and it offers over a dozen different weapons that can be upgraded using plug-ins. It is also possible to hack into turrets (by picking they identical number from two lines of data) and turning them against their masters. There are thirteen missions in total. Multiplayer is available on five different maps for up to eight players, supporting both Ad Hoc and Infrastructure.</Overview>

    <Overview>Corpse Party is an adventure game that uses hand-drawn 2D sprite and tile art to tell the story of a group of Kisaragi Academy High School students who are trapped in a haunted elementary school filled with the decaying corpses and tormented souls of countless children whod mysteriously vanished from the Japanese countryside years, months or sometimes only days prior. Desperately trying to escape and survive, players will experience unnatural, unnerving and decidedly uncensored horrors through the eyes and ears -- of these frightened teenaged victims. Detailed 2D sprite animations and art stills show the bloody and unsettling fates that await those who enter, and full Japanese-language voice-acting combines with 3D audio support to create a simulated surround sound experience when playing with headphones, offering players a delightfully uncomfortable level of immersion.</Overview>

    <Overview>A gory, disturbing and uncomfortably exhilarating tale of mystery, fear and survival, in the tradition of the greatest Japanese horror classics!
Join eight students and one teacher as they inadvertently invoke a powerful curse and find themselves wandering the haunted halls of Heavenly Host -- a constantly shifting echo of a tragedy-stricken elementary school that should have been torn down decades ago. With vengeful spirits lurking around every corner and an omnipresent pressure in the air threatening to break what's left of their sanity, they must race against their own impending dooms to solve the mystery of where and when they are, cataloguing the rotting corpses of their own unsuccessful predecessors all the while.
Featuring retro-styled 2D visuals, agonizingly detailed art stills, binaural 3D audio with original Japanese voices, over two dozen endings and some truly twisted depictions of death, this story-driven horror adventure is the perfect nightmare fuel.</Overview>

    <Name>Corpse Party: The Anthology: Sachiko no Renai Yuugi: Hysteric Birthday 2U</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2012-08-02T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Sachiko Shinozaki, tragically murdered at age 7; such a sweet girl, taken away at such a young and tender age! Sure, she may have reacted by becoming a bloodthirsty, vengeful spirit responsible for the deaths of countless other children, as well as their erasures from history, but everyone knows that in her heart of hearts, she’s just an ordinary, innocent little 7-year-old…right?

Well, no. Because you see, today is her birthday! She’ll be turning…7 again, naturally. But in celebration, she’s decided to grant all her victims 24 hours of amnesty from their suffering by gathering them all together for a…hysteric? birthday bash. There will be party games, entertainment, adventure, and most of all, romance!

Join Sachiko and the lovable cast of damned souls from previous Corpse Party games—along with a few new faces—as they take the very concept of genre and toss it aside. Prepare to experience terror, discomfort, joviality, and confusion in equal measure as Heavenly Host Elementary plays less-than-heavenly host to cooking contests, co-ed mixers, interpretive stage drama, traditional party games, and Lovecraftian horrors alike.

Because you know what they say: Hell hath no fury like a 7-year-old girl bored…

A (surprisingly) canonical “midquel” to Corpse Party and Corpse Party: Book of Shadows, taking place sometime during the course of those games, Corpse Party: Sweet Sachiko’s Hysteric Birthday Bash recounts the bizarre events of vengeful ghost girl Sachiko Shinozaki’s one-of-a-kind birthday party held in the otherworldly school where so many lives have been lost in previous games: Heavenly Host Elementary.

The game plays out as a visual novel, divided into eight main chapters that each detail a different activity or cluster of activities. Player decisions determine which of the game’s endings is attained, with only one true ending from each chapter leading into the next. Surviving to the end will require thinking like Sachiko and making the choices that will please her the most…but with the fewest casualties.</Overview>

    <Name>Cover Girl</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-10-15T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Cover Girl is aimed at a female audience and it is described as a 'way to become a Truly Fabulous Female'. The game starts by asking some personals details. You enter your name, date of birth, and your favourite music style. You then choose one of the three available female characters that will guide you through the game. The player then gets to access the Cover Girl magazine where the content is customized based on a number of questions. The game for instance asks you whether numbers or letters attempt you more, if you are in the mood for food choices or to release your inner child, and if you are more interested in being dressed to kill than deadweight dumping. The game then generates a Cover Girl magazine based on your preferences.

As a digital magazine the player can then read articles about the behaviour of men, horoscopes, recipes, do a tarot session, answer questions in a sex-o-meter quiz, consult the Manlation to get to know the behaviour of men, complete a Purse-onality quiz to find the perfect purse or do Sudoku puzzles. After going through a number of items a new issue becomes available with new content based on the same themes. It also includes a size translator to compare and convert the different clothes and shoes sizes around the world. There are 25 mini-games in total and over 100 quizzes. Additional magazines were unlocked afterwards and made available through the PlayStation Store.</Overview>

    <Overview>In Crash of the Titans, players fight a nefarious plot hatched by Crash's arch nemeses Neo and Nina Cortex to mutate the local creatures into titanic abominations. Using Crash's legendary mix of outrageous antics and daredevil bravado, players "hijack" enemies to take control of their action and use their fearsome powers against all manner of enemies. "Jack to Attack!" Control, play and battle as 15 enemies, including titanic creatures such as Scorporilla, Ratcicle, Magamadon and Shellephant. While in control of a monster players can throw toxic stink bombs, call lightning down from the sky, fire lasers beams from their eyes or even impale enemies with a massive scorpion tail - use all of the creatures' special abilities to defeat Neo and Nina Cortex. Crash now has a powerful acrobatic fighting system that includes punches and flying kicks, multiple attacks and special counter moves. Players can power-up skills to unlock new attacks and blazing combos. Crash can now interact with his world in totally new ways. Players can wall-run, swing from ropes and flip off springboards Crash can even toss Aku Aku on the ground to surf, skate, grind and shred. At any point in the game, a second player can join in the fun and play as Carbon-Crash to help unleash total chaos. In a totally innovative twist to co-op action gaming, Crash can even jack Carbon-Crash (or vice versa) for some hysterical Crash "jacked"-Crash mayhem.</Overview>

    <Overview>Crash: Mind over Mutant is the sequel to Crash of the Titans and continues the storyline of its predecessor.

The Titans from the previous game have broken free from Dr. Cortex' control and have settled down on various places on Wumpa Islands. But Cortex has teamed up with Nitrus Brio to develop a device which can control both the Bandicoots and the Titans. Now Crash and his friends must find out where Cortex is hiding and stop him before he can act out his devious plan.

Crash can use a light-powered attack to defeat smaller enemies, but for bigger enemies, a more high-powered attack is needed. Crash can also block and dodge attacks. Just like in Crash of the Titans, Crash can take control of the Titans which he encounters. But this time he can take the Titans with him and use them when he needs it. As Crash defeats more and more enemies, he can upgrade both his own attacks and the attacks of the Titans in his possession.</Overview>

    <Name>Criminal Girls</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2010-11-18T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>In Criminal Girls, the player takes the role of a prison warden in Hell who has been assigned to a group of seven girls. Although these seven have all been damned to Hell for their sins in life, they qualify for an early release program in which they must climb a tower to earn a second chance in the realm of the living. However, they are defiant and rebellious, not wanting to do what they're told. The player must therefore whip the girls into shape, sometimes literally, in order to help them complete their rehabilitation. On their way up the tower, the girls must fight other prisoners in RPG-style battles.

One of the main gameplay mechanics is Motivation, through which the girls learn new skills, gain the will to fight, and come to terms with their sins. It plays out as a minigame in which the player uses items such as whips and shock devices to destroy "temptations" that appear on the screen, after which they can cuddle with the girl. The minigame is accompanied by images of the chosen girl in suggestive poses.</Overview>

    <Name>Crimson Gem Saga</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-05-26T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Killian von Rohcoff's life has started out bad, and is about to get worse. He shakes off a hangover to get to his graduation only to find out he's finished second to his hated rival. Then when he finally gets a lead on a job, it ends up getting him robbed and nearly killed...and that's just the beginning. Soon Killian and his new "acquaintances" will end up getting caught up in much larger events that revolve around an ancient artifact called the Wicked Stone.

Crimson Gem Saga is a turn-based RPG and a follow-up to Astonishia Story, with overworld travel being done on an isometric plane. The game has some minor action elements sprinkled into the turn-based gameplay, like critical combo chains and an ambush system. Characters level up individually, but all draw from a group pool of skill points in order to unlock and gain new skill abilities, some of which are combination attacks. In essence, the core gameplay is very similar to a Japanese RPGs, despite the fact that the game was developed by a Korean company.</Overview>

    <Overview>Crisis Core is an action role-playing game in which the player controls Zack Fair. The player moves Zack through and between open areas, allowing him to talk with non-player characters, interact with the environment, and engage monsters in battle. At save points, the player may opt to take one of the available side missions, and if so, Zack is moved to a special area to complete the mission, which usually involves defeating one or more monsters. If the mission is successfully completed, the player is rewarded with beneficial items, and often new missions become available. Whether the player is successful in the side mission or not, upon completion, Zack is returned to the save point in the main game.</Overview>

    <Overview>Cube is a puzzle game with action elements. The game is set in a cubic world with different stages and challenges. Players control a cube through tracks that act like 3D platforms and mazes. There are 135 levels based on nine themes in total. The different themes (called zones in the game) come with their own contraptions and a specific colour. Dangers include bombs, creatures, sinking surfaces, rotating blocks, blocks that blow the cube backwards and more. Sometimes these also need to be manipulated to create new paths (e.g. moving blocks and then luring a bomb to blow it up).</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2014-04-14T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Super Robot Wars Z2 is the sequel to 2008's Super Robot Wars Z. This is the first in a two-game series, and some anime will only have their stories partially completed in this game. Despite this, the developer claims that Z2 will feature more missions than any other handheld SRW.  

Z2 introduces many popular series from the latter half of the previous decade, including Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann, Gundam 00, and Code Geass. However, this game also marks the debut of Armored Trooper Votoms, one of the earliest pioneers of the "Real Robot" genre of mecha anime.</Overview>

    <Overview>Super Robot Wars Z2: Saise-hen, yet another game in Namco Bandai's Super Robot Wars series, is the immediate sequel to Super Robot Wars Z2: Hakai-hen.

Despite its billing as a two-part game, Saise-hen is entirely independent of Hakai-hen. Players will receive a starting bonus in Saise-hen based on how many times they have completed Hakai-hen, along with an extra bonus for playing all of Hakai-hen's scenarios, but unlocked machines and pilots will not transfer.

Every series from Hakai-hen returns, with their sequels/second seasons debuting if applicable. Macross 7 makes its Z-series debut, with Dynamite 7 appearing for the first time in any SRW. The only completely new series, Tetsujin 28, is the 1980s incarnation of a robot series that predates even Mazinger.</Overview>

    <Name>Daikoukai Jidai IV: Rota Nova</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2006-03-23T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Rota Nova was released by KOEI on March 23, 2006, for the PlayStation Portable and Nintendo DS. This is a remake of Porto Estado for handhelds. 

The fourth game in the series was released for both PlayStation and PC under Windows 2000 and XP. This game returns to the previous formula, although its open-endedness has decreased and the engine has been updated. This title is plot-wise unrelated to the series that ended in Gaiden. Porto Estado is known for its fine art and high-quality illustrations.

The story evolves on the search of the seven Proof of the Conqueror, which are seven ancient artifacts, in seven areas around the world (Northern Europe, Mediterranean, Africa, New World, Indian Ocean, South Asia and East Asia). It is said that having these proofs proves that the sailor is the champion of all sailors. Four sailors (plus another three in expansion) unwittingly involved in the struggle of the quest of the search of the Proof of the Conqueror. It is interesting that not all sailors are from Europe: two of the seven characters are from Asia (one from East Asia and another from southeast Asia), one from the Caribbean and another one from the Middle East.

There are many significant changes in this game. For example, the game no longer has the concept of years and the result is that characters in this game will not age. The player can also set up regional fleets and these regional fleets are valuable financial resources. In combat, naval battle is now fought in real time.

The country boundaries have disappeared. Each character is only represented by their own guild and their home country is not important in gameplay. Ports in this game also have a market share rating in a percentage scale. Players can trade in a port only when his guild has some market share in that port, which can be gained by signing a contract with the local governor.</Overview>

    <Overview>The game takes place on a battlefield of hexagons. The player must assemble an army of up to 50 units with limited funds available, and should capture cities and factories to increase its coffers. A mission can be won if the player captures the enemy capital, wipes out all enemy units, or eliminates all enemy forces and destroys or captures their factory.

The units are real-life versions of existing military hardware from several nations. Through combat experience, the player can unlock two more versions of a certain unit (such as the American AH-64 Apache being upgraded to Longbow Block II and Longbow Block III configurations). Other units can also be unlocked by completing a series of individual missions, which can then be used in the campaign and skirmish modes. The factions in the game are fictional versions of Japan, the United States, Russia, China, Iraq, and Britain, with Germany as a secret faction.

Portable 2's campaign takes place in the Middle East. Like in the first game, the player is a commander in the Wild Geese mercenary force aiding either one of two factions. There are 28 stages in all, but the player may not be able to access all of them in one play-through. Certain conditions such as failing to take the enemy capital by the end of the last turn, can unlock the other stages.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2010-11-25T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The story is shown from the point of view of the protagonist, Makoto Naegi, who starts a new year at the elitist private school Hope's Peak Academy which is renowned for educating students that are top of their expertise. These students are given the title of "Ultimate". However, every year the school hosts a raffle where every average student nation-wide is entered and a random student is picked and enters the school as "Ultimate Good Luck" - Makoto Naegi is one of whom.

The story revolves around 15 students who are trapped in the school under the control of sadistic bear named Monokuma. To escape, the students must "graduate" the school. To do this, one must murder a classmate. After a body has been discovered, the rest of the students must work together to discover the culprit. If the culprit can fool the rest of their classmates, then they alone can graduate the school but the rest of the students will be punished. However, if the classmates uncover the true culprit, then they alone will be punished with a gruesome execution while everyone else remains unharmed.

While Monokuma releases motives to encourage students to commit a murder, the students also try to uncover the secrets of the school, including why they were trapped there in the first place.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2011-09-29T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Capitalizing on the vampire craze the world seems to be in, players of Dead End will control some high school kids and fight society’s new favorite villain. Its gameplay is styled like a choose-your-own-adventure book. Remember those? Each action in the game (such as “Go left” or “Open the door”) is represented by a numbered “paragraph” in the story, and players spend the game jumping from paragraph to paragraph. This means that there are multiple story branches, and players could play the game several times without even seeing all of the story. Jumping from paragraph to paragraph will also be used to solve puzzles within the game.

Fights within the game involve dice rolls, with certain numbers corresponding to different attacks and skills for both the player and enemy.</Overview>

    <Overview>Aspashia is a majin princess that lives in the magic kingdom of EVUU. One day, her magic suddenly disappears and her father, the king, says it must be because her mother was human.

Aspashia learns that in order to get her magic back, she must travel down to earth and grant the wishes of humans. By granting small wishes, she will get a small amount back, but in order to get a large amount back, she must grant true, large wishes. However, people keep these wishes secret, so it will take time for her to figure them out, time that she can’t use to grant small wishes.

Aspashia has a limited amount of time to get all her magic back, or she’ll have to remain on earth as a human for the rest of her life.</Overview>

    <Overview>Overlord Laharl has decided to cut the Prinnies' salaries after he has been "assassinated". As a Prinny who found a magic watch, the player has to go back in time to find out what has really happened. To do so, Prinny can possess various characters from the Disgaea series and follow them through the plot. In order to change the past, he can also Mind Control the character he is possessing when said character has to make a choice. Mind control allows Prinny to select one of three options that will change the series of events from that point. At a few points in the game, when major events occur or are prevented from occurring, Prinny's soul is "saved", meaning that the next time travel will send him back to that specific point to start over. The goal of the game is to start over and over, finding as much information as possible and prevent Laharl from being "assassinated" and saving the future of the Prinnies' salaries.

The story is presented in the form of dialogues between the characters, as well as sprite animations. And has many different endings, depending of the choices made by the player. The endings are themselves often short advertisings for Disgaea and Nippon Ichi Software games.

To follow the story's progress, the player has access to a time table of all the events, following every character's steps, Prinny's diary, giving clues about the plot and how to change how the story unfolds, and a database of the characters, places and other trivia from the Disgaea series, and sometimes for other Nippon Ichi Software games.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2007-10-30T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Disgaea is a tactical role playing game. Battle gameplay takes place on a map divided into a square grid. The player controls a squad of humanoid units and monsters, which each occupy a single square of the grid and do combat with a group of enemies. Depending on the character and attack selected, the player will be able to deal damage to a specific enemy unit or a designated region of the map. Combat ends when all enemy units or all of the player's units are destroyed.
Humanoid characters may lift and throw other units across the map in order to allow allies to move further or force enemies to keep their distance. This even allows the player to capture enemies by throwing them into the base panel; these enemies then become allies, and can be used on subsequent maps. The chance of capturing an enemy in this manner depends on several factors. Failure to capture the enemy will result in the death of all characters inside the base panel, and the enemy will survive.</Overview>

    <Overview>The prequel to Square Enix's 2009 title Dissidia: Final Fantasy, Dissidia 012 also contains the original's story remade to fit the new mechanics. Dissidia 012 tells the tale of the twelfth cycle of the ongoing War of the Gods, and the heroes summoned to the realm for that cycle.

The goal of the game is to defeat a given opponent, or a gauntlet of opponents, depending on the free-play style chosen, or to complete a series of dungeons containing opponents in story-mode. Largely the same as its predecessor, gameplay-wise, it nonetheless contains modifications such as the Assist system, through which you can call another character to execute attacks on your opponent, or take a hit for you. The story mode also has the addition of a free-roam game world, retaining the tile-based system of its predecessor only for dungeons entered from the gameworld via "gateways". As before, it retains the character level-up and equipment/skill customisation elements.

A rather large character roster now includes characters from Final Fantasy I to Final Fantasy XIII and every game in between.</Overview>

Now, however, things are getting better for him. His health has improved; he only experiences the occasional seizure. Also, he's been enrolled in his uncle's distinguished institution, the Asao Private School.

Of course, this fortuitous turn isn't without a catch. His uncle, a rather mysterious man, installed Ranmaru at Asao to serve as his spy.

    <Name>DJ Max Portable</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2006-01-14T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>DJ Max Portable for the PSP is an adaptation of the online-enabled PC game DJ MAX. It follows the gameplay style established by Konami's Beatmania series, where the player is presented with a sheet of notes falling down the screen. As the notes fall, the player hits the correct key at the correct time, and in effect they play along with the music, activating key parts of the song.

Unlike the PC version, which emphasizes competitive online multiplayer, DJ Max Portable is limited to being a strictly solitary experience. It features fifty tracks ranging in styles from techno to trance to dance and to some R&amp;B music. Further extending the longevity of the game is the ability to select from a variety of difficulty levels, denoted by the number of buttons used (i.e. 4key, 6key, 8key) to play the song.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2008-02-05T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Downstream Panic! is a colourful puzzle game that mixes elements from LocoRoco with Worms.

A massive cyclone has sucked all of the fish out of the oceans! The player must safely guide them back. Levels start at the top of the area where the fish are contained in a blob of water. They need to reach the ocean safely at the bottom of the screen with guidance of the player.

Using a variety of creative tools like fans, onions, rockets, and cloud factories, the fish can be guided through platforms, past hungry sharks, piranhas and many other dangers. The tools can also be used to control the flow of the water and the direction the fish travel. Plants will stop the flow and by blowing flowers bridges are opened. At the start of the level, the area usually needs to be scanned first using the free camera perspective to discover all the hazards. Certain fish can be sacrificed, but a sufficient number of them needs to reach the ocean.

The regular mode eventually unlocks the Free Play and Survival modes. In Free Play the player can spend the money from regular games to buy tools for the stages. In survival all levels are replayed in succession, but lost fish are not regained in the next level.</Overview>

    <Overview>Based on the Scarygirl graphic novel created by acclaimed artist Nathan Jurevicius, Dr Maybee and the Adventures of Scarygirl is a marvelous adventure through the Scarygirl universe, as she attempts to discover the identity of the mysterious, bearded man haunting her dreams. With help from her friends, the quick-witted Bunniguru and Blister the giant octopus, she will journey from her treehouse home in the forest to an overwhelmingly unfriendly city in her quest to locate Dr Maybee.
Features
Surreal Art by Nathan Jurevicius: Scarygirl's fantastic landscape and creatures are both beautiful and bizarre to behold
Scarygirl &amp; Friends: Calling them a ‘colorful’ cast of characters would be an understatement. Scarygirl, the part-octopus girl who dresses like a pirate, has a tentacle for her right hand and has naught but a bone for her left, is the star here, though each friendly or treacherous creature she meets will certainly be unique
It's a Completist's Paradise: In each level, players can search high and low for hundreds of gems, fish, and other items to collect.</Overview>

    <Overview>The game's story mode is based on the events of the movie Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn. The choices the player makes in the story determine how the story evolves.

Another mode is the Arcade mode, a single-player mode that lets you brawl against the CPU in order to fight and gain the Dragon Balls. Next is the Z trial mode, which consists of two different types of play: survival, where you fight against CPU-controlled opponents for as long as you can, and time attack, where you see how fast you can make it through a predetermined set of opponents.

Finally, there’s the Profile Card mode in which the players will have their in-game character profile cards that lists their name and power level. The player can design their own card and customize them with the items from the game's item store.</Overview>

    <Name>Dragon's Lair</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-03-29T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>From deep within Mordroc's castle, a foul stench rose up to mix with the cold, damp midnight air; the telltale sign of the evil wizard's pet fire-breathing dragon, Singe; the reeking breath of the beast that guarded the Princess Daphne in the dark and deadly caves far below the surface. Dirk the Daring walked steadily toward the castle gate. He felt no fear. Fear was for cowards, not the most courageous knight in the land. No other would dare enter this perilous castle where Mordroc had imprisoned the helpless princess. But then, no other could match Dirk's unrelenting love for the beautiful Princess Daphne. There was no other possible course of action. Now was the time for heroes. Now was the time to enter the Dragon's Lair!

A portable version of the classic FMV videogame. In this single-player action game, you play as heroic knight Dirk the Daring as he journeys to a mysterious castle filled with danger, in order to save the fair Princess Daphne from the forces of evil and the towering dragon Singe. Dragon's Lair features full-motion animation directed by Don Bluth, the man behind animated films such as the Secret of Nimh and Titan AE. It takes fast reflexes and a good memory to remember the safe way through each section of the deadly castle. Do you have what it takes to guide Dirk to the end and save Princess Daphne?</Overview>

    <Name>Driver 76</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2007-05-08T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Driver '76 is the fifth game in the Driver series and the first since Ubisoft acquired the license from Atari. The game is a prequel to Driver: Parallel Lines, set two years before the events, and features two side characters from Parallel Lines: Ray (controlled by the player) and Slink. Ray has set his eyes on the daughter of a Triad boss and tries to impress him by taking on tough jobs. This gets him in a lot of trouble with the other gangs, and the story, divided over 6 chapters, is presented in comic-book style.

There are 27 missions, set in New York, from New Jersey to Coney Island, with several distinguishable districts, and over 40 customizable vehicles, from dirt bikes to sports cars and big rigs, and some surprises such as the Ghostbusters' Ecto-1 - all with different handling. Players have complete freedom to move about, but the mission structure is linear. Tasks include time-limited runs, escorting and evading missions. Ray can also move on foot, and wreak havoc with a number of guns, along with locked targetting.

During the main game the characters can accept side jobs to earn additional cash, such as closed-course or open-road racing, driving a tow-truck, a taxi or an ambulance, and money can be spend in the garage to upgrade the vehicles.

Multiplayer is supported for up to 2 players over WiFi with Street Racing, Carnage, Circuit Racing, Pink Slip Racing and Swap Meet. Players can also swap items over W-Lan or download new paint jobs. Next to the main game, there are also a few minigames.</Overview>

    <Overview>Duæl Invaders is an old-school, fixed-screen shoot 'em up, mixing the classic formula seen in countless great '80s games with its own unique brand of simultaneous 2-ship control. The game’s concept is centered on the idea of controlling two player ships simultaneously (on a single PSP or PS3 controller) across single player and 2-player co-operative and adversarial game modes.

In all modes your ships (one red, one blue) are tasked with destroying wave upon wave of red and blue enemies; the idea being to survive, waste the bad guys and attain the highest score possible. Some of your enemies will cause chain reactions or change other enemies’ colors, so picking out the best shots will really help you survive and rack up those high scores!</Overview>

    <Overview>Dungeons &amp; Dragons Tactics is a fantasy role-playing game, utilizing the 3.5 Edition core rule set, which takes place in the eastern border reaches of the Lindesi, a group of kingdoms governed by a human High-King far to the West,

Players begin a campaign by selecting or creating a character to be the hero, then selecting, or creating a group of companions to form the party. At the start, you may only have five companions in your party, but as the campaign continues, you may recruit up to eleven companions. You may select pre-generated characters, create your own group of characters for the party, or even use the quick-start option which will automatically provide you with a set of pre-generated characters. If the main hero you create or select for the campaign dies, the campaign will end. You may select from all eleven core character classes: barbarian, bard, cleric, druid, fighter, monk, paladin, ranger, rogue, sorcerer, and wizard, plus the psionic warrior and psion. Additional party members you may recruit during the adventure are found in the marketplace, for example, you may recruit clerics and paladins at the Temple, and fighters, barbarians and psychic warriors may be recruited at the Mercenary Hall.

The adventure is played by moving the party icon along the map, where you make choices on which locations to enter, and with whom you may interact, but combat is handled in turn-based tactics fashion, on a grid with five-foot squares, where initiative determines the order when each character moves, and each character during their turn may perform actions according to the 3.5 Edition combat rules. Each character, however, has several options during their turn from the Action menu. Spells and psionics are also available for the appropriate characters. For those unfamiliar with the 3.5 Edition rule set, the manual has a glossary of D&amp;D rules terms and there is a glossary available from the main menu in the game.

Wireless multiplayer mode allows you to host or join a game with up to four players, featuring game modes such as Dungeon Bash, or Deathmatch Battle, but you are only permitted to use pre-generated characters.</Overview>

    <Name>Dynasty Warriors</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2005-03-16T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Koei's Dynasty Warriors series hits the handheld market in it's first fully 3D form on the PSP. As an officer in a Chinese army (Wei, Wu or Shu armies), you fight and kill thousands of soldiers in massive battles stretched over numerous battlefields - either in the campaign "Musou" modes or the single battle "Free" mode which can be used to train.

Each stage consists of a map split in numerous areas. From the map, the player selects an area he has access to (areas are connected to each other in certain directions, and the player can only move to an area connected to the one he his currently in); if the area has enemy units, a battle field similar to the ones in the main Dynasty Warriors games, albeit smaller, will load. In each areas, the enemy squads must be eliminated for the area to be liberated. When such an area is under enemy control, bonuses such as supplies that increase the remaining time to complete the stage, are acquired. As characters defeats enemies, they gain experience points and level-up.

New to this PSP version is a bodyguard system where your selected second officer can give you certain items or abilities, for example one ensures you always have a horse when entering an area, and others can give you special powered up Musou attacks.</Overview>

    <Name>Dynasty Warriors Vol. 2</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2006-10-24T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Dynasty Warriors Vol.2 is the second installment is the long-running Dynasty Warriors series to be developed exclusively for PSP. Like its predecessor, the game retells the story from Luo Guangzhong's Romance of the Three Kingdoms by having the player control an officer from the Wu, Wei or Shu kingdoms through the most important battles of each kingdom's storyline. The playable characters and their appearance are taken from Dynasty Warriors 5.

Each scenario has branching stages, which can be be unlocked by playing the same scenario but choosing a different path. Each battle can then be played in free mode.

The battles consist of a map separated in numerous smaller areas. These areas can be allied or enemy camps, supply depots, or open fields. The player has to move from area to area, entering a battlefield when the area is under enemy control or is attacked by the enemy army. Defeating enemy officers and squads until their troop's morale drops to 0 will liberate the area, sometimes yielding rewards such as supplies, which add to the total time of the battle, uncover hidden areas, or refill some health.

Before each stage, the player can equip a different weapon and mount, and choose up to four generic officers to accompany the selected character. Each of these officers has a level, rank, squadron units, and special abilities that will influence the outcome of the battle. Which officer can be selected depends on the player character's command stat. If the command number is 30, it means that officers with a combined level of 30 can be selected.

In battle, the player has to defeat as many foes as possible by combining regular attacks and charge attacks, and unleashing the series' signature Musou attack. Different weapons allow for more combo attacks and higher attack strength. By defeating enemies, the character will gain experience and level up. However, the level resets between battle, and the gained experience is converted into points to raise the officers ranks. Once a stage's winning conditions are met, the army is deemed victorious, but if the player character is defeated, supplies get exhausted or the main camp is taken, the game is over. Upon victory, the player is rewarded with new officers and weapons or mounts acquired in battle.

New playable characters are unlocked by completing the Musou mode. Different characters get unlocked depending on which scenario is played, and which battles are won.

Other than the Musou (Story) mode, the game has a Free mode, and Multiplayer mode. The Multiplayer mode allows for up to four players via Ad Hoc and offers different games: Bombs Away, Battle Royal, Time Attack and Sudden Death.</Overview>

Echochrome challenges the player to abide by 5 simple laws of perspective, which govern how the player advances through each stage.

The player controls an infinite canvas, guiding a mannequin figure by carefully controlling the perspective, tilting and turning the level to create a continual pathway for the mannequin to walk safely through the design. Throughout the encounter, the mannequin will be guided by echos, or shadow guides, used as progress points to advance players along the pathway. There is no set pathway for any level in Echochrome. Players will find different and limitless ways to advance through each stage.</Overview>

    <Overview>Half a year after the events of Trails in the Sky Second Chapter, Liberl has settled into peace once againbut even during peaceful times, there are many among the distinguished and fortunate burning with greed thanks to the influence of ancient artifacts. Most of the population remains unaware of their abuses of power, but to the most enigmatic order of the beloved Septian Church, the Gralsritter, snuffing out these would-be villains and claiming artifacts in their name is as everyday as professing one's faith in the Goddess.

On the eve of another successfully completed mission, high-ranking member Father Kevin Graham is immediately assigned to retrieve one more artifact that rests beneath Grancel Cathedral. What's more, even though this is a task he could easily complete on his own, he must reluctantly do so in partnership with his newest recruit, rookie Gralsritter and childhood friend Sister Ries Argent.

Thus begins the start of a routine mission that becomes anything but, delving into a new and mysterious realm that follows an unnaturally strict set of rules: Phantasma. Therein, the history of the Septian Church and the pasts of the many familiar faces who took up arms for the sake of Liberl's future will be laid bareand some may have been better off staying forever sealed behind closed doors.</Overview>

The game takes place in Crossbell City, a city where light and darkness are together, as well as locations arround it. Crossbell City takes place far from the setting of Sora no Kiseki, Liberl Kingdom, in a land northeast of the Erebonian Empire. The buildings, roads, as well as most of the NPCs' clothings, are more onto that of 1960's, but with a mix of what China Town would look like in certain places. There are also elements that were not in Sora no Kiseki games, such as the Police Department, cars, and a strip club. The transportation system will be riding trains or busses, but no Airliner like in the past Sora no Kiseki games.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2009-03-12T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Ever 17 is set in Japan, in the underwater marine theme park LeMU, 51 meters below the surface of the artificial island Insel Null. After an incident, almost half of LeMU is flooded, and the path to the surface and the communication lines are cut off, trapping the game's characters inside. In addition, LeMU is under large water pressure, limiting time to find a means of escape to 119 hours. The player takes the roles of two characters, and sees the story from their respective perspectives: Takeshi Kuranari, a student who visited the park with his friends but got separated from them; and an amnesiac boy who does not remember his own name, and is simply called "the Kid". Among other characters are You Tanaka, a part-time employee at LeMU; Tsugumi Komachi, a woman who is distrustful of the others; Sora Akanegasaki, an artificial intelligence and the computer engineer of LeMU, who is only seen through a projection onto the other characters' eyes; Sara Matsunaga, a second-year student and a hacker; and Coco Yagami, a girl who is stranded on LeMU with her dog Pipi.</Overview>

    <Name>Everyday Shooter</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2008-12-04T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Everyday Shooter is an abstract shooter by Jonathan Mak released through the PlayStation network. Although seemingly a top-down arcade shooter, the title is described as an album of games, where music, gameplay and visuals are interwoven, inspired by the Rez concept. The player controls a pixel-shaped character through a series of 8 fixed-screen stages, using one stick to move and another one to shoot. The overall goal is to clear the stage of all enemies, but the mechanics to achieve this vary in each level. The same applies for combos and chain reactions. Sometimes enemies cannot be defeated directly, but require a sequence of colors or a special object that triggers the entire field. There is only a single gun with no upgrades or changes.

Each stage has a different soundtrack toned to match the visuals. All sounds of destruction have been replaced by guitar notes or riffs, leading to a sea of sound that harmonizes with the overall soundtrack, causing the music to be generated procedurally.

Next to the main goal there are bonus points to collect, used to unlock extras such as extra lives and new graphical effects. Completing a level opens it up in the Single Play mode, where it can be selected right away.</Overview>

    <Overview>EyePet is a pet simulation game with minigames and customization. Modeled after the original PS3 game it changes a few things for the portable format. The game requires a PSP camera and a "magic card" (included within the game package) to play. By pointing the PSP with the camera attached on the magic card the player makes the cute creature appear on screen. The player can play a variety of games with the pet, such as bowling, fishing or jumping on trampolines. The game encourages playing in different environments; by doing so the player has a chance of finding "treasures" - customization items. In a separate in-game area called Pet home the player may take care of the pet - feed it, wash it etc. and also change its appearance to their liking.</Overview>

    <Name>F1 Grand Prix</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2005-09-01T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>FIA licensed Formula 1 racing game including the 2005 season teams, drivers, cars, and circuits. The player controls the car on the track and tries to either complete a lap in fastest possible time, or race against either computer controlled drivers (or in multiplayer mode, against other players) and finish in top position.

Game can be played in Quick Grand Prix, Event, World Championship, and Multiplayer modes. Quick Grand Prix selects a random car and circuit to race. Event modes are Time Attack (race against ghost car), Single Grand Prix, and Scenario Mode in which the player needs to complete different kinds of racing tasks such as completing a lap with failed brakes and pitting in to fix them. Each successfully completed scenario unlocks the next one. Additional scenarios are available for download to PSP.

World Championship mode lets the player to choose the team to race in and the championship season difficulty. All 19 circuits of the 2005 F1 season are raced in order and points for finishing in positions 1-8 are awarded. Driver with most points at the end of the season wins the championship. Before each race the player can drive practice laps to get familiar with the track and the car setup. Player can also drive a single lap qualifying run which will determine the grid position at the race start.

The difficulty levels (easy, medium, hard) define the total number of laps, weather conditions, pit stops, and tyre wear. Initially only the easy level is selectable and must be completed successfully in top three in order to unlock the medium level. In same manner, the medium level must be completed in top three to unlock the hard level. Also the Single Grand Prix Event is unlocked by successfully completing the easy level.

In Multiplayer mode, up to 8 players can play in three different race types. As in singleplayer Time Attack, each car races against top time ghost car. Both Head to Head and Single Grand Prix modes allow players to race a single grand prix, the difference being that in the latter mode, computer controlled AI drivers are entered to fill the grid if less than eight players enter.

F1 Grand Prix also includes a TV Mode Race where AI cars race each other and the player has no control, except selecting the camera view.

All 2005 season cars are initially available but the game has unlockable F1 cars from past years, such as Lotus-Climax 25, turbo powered Williams FW11, and Cosworth classics Lotus-Ford 79 and Williams FW08. Overall game style is more arcade than simulation, eg. collisions do not cause any noticeable damage, after a spin-out the car is automatically pointed to the right direction, and driving off-track slows the car down. A simple car setup system has three presets: Defensive, Balanced, and Aggressive. Player can also enable Brake Assist which automatically applies brakes in corners if the speed is too high.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2006-10-17T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The Griffin family from Fox's animated TV series makes its way to video gaming for the first time.

In this action-adventure, which runs like an episode from the show, players control Peter, Brian and Stewie through various goals and adventures.

After being hit on the head by a satellite dish, Peter wakes up in a hospital believing that Mr. Belvedere (from the 1980's sitcom) has kidnapped his family, and everyone in town is an accomplice. Peter makes his way through town beating up anyone who gets in his path, in a side-scrolling beat-em-up fighting mode.

Brian is falsely accused of impregnating Carter Pewterschmidt's prized racing dog Seabreeze. Brian must escape the police station without being seen and collect evidence proving that he is not the father. Brian's game mode relies heavily on stealth/espionage gameplay.

Stewie's battle against his half-brother Bertram continues as Stewie must destroy everything in his path to infiltrate a hospital and the inside of Peter in order to find Bertram's lair and stop him from taking over the world. Stewie's adventure takes place as a platformer action game with shooting elements.

Much like the show, there are segues which translate into mini-games that will yield power-ups for each mission if completed successfully.</Overview>

    <Overview>Fast-paced and strategic, Fat Princess: Fistful of Cake pits two hordes of players against each other in a comic medieval battle on the PSP. The player's goal is to rescue a beloved princess from the enemy castle. There is a catch, though; the adversary has been feeding her magical cake to make her heavier to carry. Therefore, it will take much of the army working together to carry her across the battlefield. Team balance and strategy is crucial in Fat Princess: Fistful of Cake because players can switch between five different character classes, literally, at the drop of a hat. The name of the game is cooperation, whether it is flinging another player over the enemy's walls with a teeterboard, healing him while he charges into battle, or adding muscle to carry the hearty princess to safety. The comical, quirky, and loveable cast of characters in Fat Princess: Fistful of Cake has been developed specifically for optimization on the PSP. Now players can have their cake and take it on the go, too.</Overview>

    <Overview>Fate/Extra CCC is a sequel and companion game to Fate/Extra. As with its predecessor, the game was developed by Image Epoch in collaboration with TYPE-MOON. The scenario was written by Kinoko Nasu, with Takashi Takeuchi as the character designer and Arco Wada as the illustrator. 

The protagonist, Hakuno has to look for a way to escape from the world, together with his/her Servant. The story is told in different chapters from Caster's point of view with the chapter's title accompanied by description and picture related to the boss of the chapter.

Fate/Extra CCC utilizes the same turn-based, rock-paper-scissors style combat as it's predecessor with some slight tweaks. The combat UI's appearance has changed and occupies a different place on the screen. New voice lines and animations have been added for the Servants' attacks and players can now escape from battles and the floor of the dungeon they are on.</Overview>

    <Overview>Feisty Feet, is more of a traditional game with a slight twist. It’s a take on the side-scrolling running game popularized by Canabalt. You control a little guy who runs toward the right side of the screen, leaping over obstacles and from platform to platform, most of which are at different heights.
Instead of it being an infinite runner, they’ve changed the gameplay so it’s a race with other runners. It’s not just a simple race, though; it reminds me more of a kart racer. You have special power-ups that give you a speed boost and make you jump. You can also pick up weapons, ranging from a simple snowball to a rocket launcher and some sort of tangle grenade that you drop behind you to stop an opposing runner briefly.</Overview>

    <Name>FIFA Soccer 06</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2005-10-11T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>FIFA Soccer 06 is the second appearance of the series on the PSP, only half a year after the previous game. It includes most of that game's modes (a cut-down selection of those from the console versions), while updating teams and rosters, revising the controls and adding several new features, including an exclusive mini-game.

The game includes teams from 25 leagues from 18 countries, along with assorted teams from the rest of the world and 40 international teams. Game modes include a play now option for friendlies and season and tournament play (each customizable). Challenges, a long-time staple of handheld entries in the series, also return, with 20 comeback and 20 rout challenges from the 2004-2005 season, the completion of which unlocks a custom challenge editor. Infrastructure multiplayer has been added in addition to the returning ad hoc mode.

The exclusive mini-game is called juggling. Choosing from one of the included licensed players, the goal is to keep the ball in the air by bouncing it on legs and head. The game is played by holding the PSP sideways so the player is in full view. An icon indicates which of the directional buttons must be pressed while the ball is in the center of the icon. The game is played for high score, with higher playing levels increasing the difficulty.

Controls during regular gameplay have been refined. In particular, the First Touch and Freestyle controls are no longer mapped to the directional pad but instead to the analog stick with the shoulder button as modifier.</Overview>

    <Overview>FIFA Soccer 07 is the third appearance of the soccer series on the PSP. It builds upon the previous year's version with updated rosters, new control options and new game modes.

The game includes 27 leagues from 20 countries (adding the Turkish league), plus various rest-of-the-world and international teams, the same selection as in the console version. Returning modes include Kick-Off for friendlies, tournaments and challenges (with 31 new comeback and 30 new rout challenges) and wi-fi multiplayer (ad-hoc and infrastructure). The manager mode, already an established feature in the console versions, makes its debut on the PSP in this game. It tasks players with managing a club team, taking care of sponsors, the club board, and fan relations in addition to success on the pitch. PSP manager careers are compatible with those from the PS2 version and can be exchanged via PS2-PSP link. Exclusive to the PSP version is player training via mini-games (which are also available on their own): the returning Juggling and the new Wall Attack. In Wall Attack, the goal is to kick the ball at a wall of colored blocks for points, with a certain number necessary within a time limit to advance to the next level. Some blocks contain icons that have additional effects, like clearing neighboring blocks or blocks of the same color.

Among the new control options are chip shots and various new configurations: there is a choice between player control via analog stick or d-pad (or both, but without on-the-fly tactics changes) and optional PES-style button layout.</Overview>

The team lineup is the same as on other platforms, adding Australian, Czech and Irish leagues for a total of 30 national leagues, along with 20 clubs from the rest of the world and 43 international teams. Returning game modes include friendlies, manager mode, tournaments, wi-fi multiplayer, challenges (updated for the new season) and the mini-games Juggling and Wall Attack.

Introduced in the previous year's console version, the Interactive Leagues mode makes its debut on the PSP in this game. It allows players to play matches of their favorite club against other players according to the real-life schedule. Another new feature is the ability to create custom formations.

An entirely new mode is called Football IQ, which is a trivia quiz. It features trivia questions with a diagram of a field next to them. Answering questions correctly moves the ball forward on the field, eventually putting it in the goal, while getting them wrong moves it backwards and lets the other team score. The quiz features several levels, starting with questions about local clubs, then later moving into other leagues.</Overview>

    <Overview>FIFA Soccer 2009 is a football (soccer) game in the long-running FIFA football game series. This PSP edition has a number of differences compared to the high-end console and PC versions.

As with previous FIFA games, you can take control of a team and guide it through its paces on a game by game, season by season basis. As well as the usual updated graphics and rosters, the portable version for the first time features the "Be a Pro" mode that the console versions have had for the 2 previous iterations. Be a Pro mode allows you to take control of a single player over the course of a season, and play match by match. At the end of each game, your performance will be critiqued. Through good performances you will become the captain of your team and possibly called up for your country. Do badly, and you will get less games and eventually get the sack.

Multiplayer games against friends are supported via infrastructure or ad hoc mode, in either a standard team game, or in the new Be a Pro Mode.</Overview>

Naturally the game retains its hugely successful on and offline multiplayer modes, with new options and better stability for online play. The manager mode has also seen a massive update to make it just as deep and complex as the main game. With all these new features and more EA Sports are betting on FIFA remaining the champions for a long time to come.</Overview>

    <Overview>FIFA 11 reinvents player authenticity - on and off the ball - for every player and at every position on the pitch with Personality+, an all-new feature that sees individual abilities reflected in game, enabling clear differentiation for every player.

With Personality+ a footballer's abilities on the pitch is mirrored authentically in game, creating individual personalities. Players will be distinguished from one another through a sophisticated database that evaluates and grades each player's skill-set over 36 attributes and 57 traits, compiled by 1700 scouts around the world. Real Madrid's Kaka will deliver crisp, creative passes, Barcelona's Andres Iniesta will utilize tighter turns and close control to dribble through defenses, Manchester United's Wayne Rooney will hold off defenders and strike shots from distance with pace, and top-flight defenders like Giorgio Chiellini of Juventus will anticipate, predict and react to offensive players to win back possession.

Goalkeepers have also been injected with Personality+. The real-life personality of the keeper, whether acrobatic or traditional, will dictate his style in game. Dive attributes will determine the keepers with the ability to reach for further shots while reflex attributes determine reaction times, so a keeper like Petr Cech of Chelsea FC will show be able to showcase world-class skills.</Overview>

    <Name>Final Fantasy Tactics: The War of the Lions</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2007-10-09T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Final Fantasy Tactics was a big move for the whole Final Fantasy franchise into different fields. Tactics combines traditional elements of the Final Fantasy series with a completely different game mechanics and battle system. It was the 1st game during the Final Fantasy 32-bit era using a 3D, isometric, rotatable playing field, with bitmap sprite characters and a turn based strategy system.

In the game you build up a team by recruiting many available characters you meet during your travels and stocking up plenty of items, to defeat various enemies waiting on your path. The game features a very complex character class(job) system where each character begins his way with a job such as Squire or Chemist. Successfully participating in battles, characters can later select one of more advanced jobs, with a total of 19 to choose from. In addition there are certain monsters and computer controlled "guests" with their own jobs and special abilities available to learn. In total, over 400 abilities are available which leads to nearly endless combinations.

The PSP version of the game mostly reiterates the original for the PSOne. Visual presentation is almost a 1:1 copy, looking like the old version with a zoomed-in camera to make it fit the PSP screen. Port developer Tose added cel-shaded introduction movies and numerous animation sequences played after each chapter ends. Some maps were completely remade as well, but you still cannot skip event scenes.

Also the PSP version features two new playable characters: Balthier, from Final Fantasy XII and Luso from Final Fantasy Tactics A2. Two new job classes have been added - the completely new Onion Knight and the Dark Knight class which was available on the PSOne only after using a cheat code. There are two wireless multiplayer options available once you've reached the world map (just go into a bar in any town). One is Coliseum (Versus Battle Mode), the second is Cooperative Challenge (team mission).</Overview>

    <Name>Final Fantasy Type-0</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-10-27T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Final Fantasy: Type-0 is an RPG in the Final Fantasy series. It is part of the Fabula Nova Crystallis project and, although not having much to do with Final Fantasy XIII, shares its mythology.

The game is a RPG in which the characters travel to get missions and attack enemy strongholds to complete them. In each mission, three characters out of 14 are selected, each having their own style, weapons and abilities. The battle system is an Active System Battle (ATB) that allows the control of many characters, Characters who were KO'd in battle must be revived in town before being used again. Each character have a unique summon that can be used for 5 minutes in battle and can be levelled-up. The ATB kai, as it is called, allows for up to three players to connect via ad-hoc and send each other emergency back-up.

Final Fantasy: Type-0 is set in the world of Orience, divided in four kingdoms: the Suzaku Fiefdom of Rubrum, the Milites Empire, the Lorican Alliance, and the Kingdom of Concordia, each having its own emblem based on four Japanese mythological beasts: the phoenix Suzaku, the Turtle Genbu, the tiger Byakko and the dragon Seiryuu. Every kingdom is in possession of a crystal that an mark humans as their servants, called l'Cie. Character growth is based on the Alto Crystarium system, using energy called phantoma to increase the character's abilities.

The later released PC, PS4 and Xbox One versions are called Final Fantasy: Type-0 HD. They are available worldwide instead of the Japan-only PSP version. The content is almost completely identical, with a focus on localization and improvised visuals. It does not have the multiplayer functionality of the PSP version, but adds additional difficulty levels.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2008-03-06T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>flOw is a PlayStation Network game, originally an online flash project by Jenova Chen and Nicholas Clark as a part of Chen's thesis research, but later adapted to a commercial game by thatgamecompany, which Chen co-founded.

The player controls a small, worm-like micro-organism on a bright, two-dimensional plane. On the PS3, it can be moved around by tilting the SIXAXIS controller in the direction the creature should swim. The PSP version is controlled with the analogue stick. There are six, gradually unlocked creatures to choose from (Snake, Jelly, Manta, Rogue, Hunter, Credit Creature), each with their own abilities such as poison, a swirling move to draw in plankton or a homing attack. The aim of the game is to eat other micro-organisms and evolve, moving deeper into the sea until the bottom is reached, leading the game to restart with a new creature. Evolving will change the creature's shape or grants new abilities. There are different power-ups, making the creature move faster or giving it a larger mouth. Certain larger enemies are made up of dots that need to be eaten to have it destroyed, requiring different strategies to take them out.

With each new level, moving deeper into the sea, the background, colours, enemies and music change. The creature is able to return to previous levels, or dive deeper, indicated by different icons. The game has straightforward controls and offers multiplayer sessions for up to 4 players, all using the same creature.

flOw applies the concept of dynamic difficulty adjustment. Players can choose to ignore large and dangerous enemies or come back to fight them later, striking a balance between the game's challenges and the individual abilities.</Overview>

    <Name>Ford Bold Moves Street Racing</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2006-10-17T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Ford Bold Moves Street Racing is the third Razorworks-developed title in the licensed Ford Racing series since they took over development in Ford Racing 2. Unlike its predecessors, this version has an urban atmosphere. The road races, off-road challenges and circuit tracks have been removed and the action has been taken entirely to the streets of Los Angeles, with 24 tracks available. As in the previous version, the 18 available cars are all Fords, ranging from the 1968 Mustang GT to the 2007 Shelby GT 500.

There are 4 main modes: Quick Race, Team Racing, Solo Racing and Multiplayer. Solo Racing offers quick races, and championships where new vehicles and tracks can be unlocked. The real novelty is the Team Racing mode, split up in single races, team championships, challenges and tutorials. Team Racing has the player control two or three vehicles in a single team during a race in modes such as Race, Elimination or Duel. The team with the highest point total wins, so the player either has to switch between the vehicles to drive (the others cars then become AI-controlled) or issue orders such as Block (slow down another vehicle) or Draft (additional speed in the slipstream) to influence the driving behaviour of the team mates. This can be extended to double or even triple actions of the same effect. Blocked cars have to brake and weave across the track until they regain control.

Racing or completing challenges earns credits, which can be spent to buy new vehicles in the showroom. Despite the urban theme, there are no tuning options. Cars can only be viewed, repaired and sold.

The PSP version adds 6 new Ford cars (1962 Thunderbird Sports Roadster, 1971 Mustang Mach 1, 2004 Bronco Concept, 2005 Shelby GR-1 Concept, 2005 SVT Sport Trac Adrenalin Concept, 2005 Thunderbird) and 7 new tracks. In the Team Racing mode, two cars can be controlled (3 in the console versions) and solo and team multiplayer is supported over Wi-Fi.

There is also an alternate Australian PS2 release Ford Street Racing (XR Edition), with 4 additional cars synonymous with the history of Ford in Australia: the 1970 Ford XY GT Falcon, the 1970 Ford XY GTHO Falcon (Phase III), the 2003 Falcon XR8 Ute and the Australian Falcon XR8. That version is also the only PSP version released in Australia.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2005-09-19T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Frantix is a puzzle-based adventure game for PSP. It features over 180 different levels. Playing as one of the heroes, the objective of the game is to collect as many gems as possible in order to advance in the world of Frantix. Though there is no story explaining why our hero is venturing through this land of puzzles, it is clear that this must be done as quickly as possible. Each stage has a gem requirement, and you can exit when you have found the required amount. The puzzles are usually based on colored gems that open specific doors.

There are six worlds (including a tutorial) where you get past hazards such as water and quick sands, avoid patrolling creatures, collect gems, manipulate crates, sneak around, build bridges, and plant explosives. There are also power-ups that allow you to walk over certain surfaces, increase speed, or provide invincibility. With short levels, Frantix can be played for five minutes or an hour with the same satisfaction.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2007-10-26T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Freak Out: Extreme Freeride is an arcade skiing game, focused on performing tricks and stunts. The main mode is Mission, where players need to jump gaps, make tricks, grind rails and pick stars. Completing the different challenges is rewarded with money, exchanged for basic equipment (skis, boots, helmets) and style equipment (jackets, goggles, gloves) at the shop. It also opens up new slopes and mountains. In Freeride the aim is to get the highest score, opening up slopes and mountains, there are four mountains in total, and earning endurance points. Bone Ride has the player collect bones against a time limit to earn balance points and beating courses in the Slope Style mode requires the player to reach a pre-defined score to receive trick skill points. These different game modes are grouped in the main Career, Single race and Multiplayer sections.

Mostly about tricks, players need to take care of their landings - touch the ground with back, front or side weight and a lower score multiplier is awarded. Next to the basic information on the screen such as time, score and stunts, the game also keeps track of your "flow", by doing consecutive tricks. There are six different characters and the arsenal of tricks includes flips, rolls, carve/cross skis, grabs, rails, jumps and specials.</Overview>

    <Name>Frogger: Helmet Chaos</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2005-09-29T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Frogger: Helmet Chaos is a top-down platform game with the eighties' arcade frog as the protagonist, but now in 3d. The basic gameplay is still the game, as the frog moves one (invisible) square per key press, which maintains the feel of the original arcade game instead of the modern, smoother movement mechanics.

When Frogger climbs a tree to get some moonfruit for Toady, his friend is gone when he returns. He follows his footprints and finds out Toady is under the control of Dr. Wani, who has ordered his mini-crocs to place mind-control helmets on all residents of the land. It is up to Frogger to undo this.

The game consists of different small levels with puzzle elements. Frogger can be moved around with one square per movement, or two for a regular jump. This mechanic is most often used to navigate maze-like platforms with water. Ironically, Frogger drowns when touching liquid. While moving around he can collect coins and there are checkpoints to save progress. He can use his tongue to push or pull objects, or swing from branches. There is also a vertical jump to reach objects mid-air and he can turn 90 degrees to face a different direction. The frog has a limited amount of lives, but one can be restored by picking up an apple.

The story is continued through drawn cut-scene sequences with static images and voice-overs (on the PSP, there is only written text for the DS version). The PSP version supports game sharing, while the DS top screen shows the game statistics while playing the story mode. There are also seven mini-games, including the original arcade Frogger but with polished graphics, and hats and costumes to unlock with the collected coins.</Overview>

    <Name>Full Auto 2: Battlelines</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2007-03-20T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Full Auto 2: Battlelines is the sequel to the auto racing combat game Full Auto, that debuted in February of 2006 on the Xbox 360. 

The PSP version of the sequel builds on the PS3 version but removes a few features for obvious reasons, resulting in more primitive damage modeling on the cars, less detailed environments and less multiplayer modes. This version does add new gameplay modes, new cars, weapons and a different storyline.

The game plays much like a mixture of Burnout and Twisted Metal. The PSP version focuses more on the Twisted Metal-style combat gameplay. During most events, winning a race is rarely a goal; the game is focused on destruction. The goals change from level to level, but most time they require eliminating a set number of enemies, or blowing up specific targets, random objects, or oncoming traffic. Unlike the PS3 version every objective needs to be completed to win the event.

The game contains two general game modes: Racing and Arena. The 'Unwreck' feature is also present and it allows the player to rewind time. The environment is however much less interactive. Most objects cannot be destroyed, only specific ones, for instance a lead pipe that lands on chasing cars. Most destruction is done to store fronts, bus stops, trash cans and other objects.

The game contains four-player Ad Hoc multiplayer. Players can race or fight in a free-for-all arena or as part of a team in multiplayer modes such as Head-On, Down &amp; Back, as well as Arena Deathmatch.</Overview>

    <Name>Gangs Of London</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2006-09-01T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>In Gangs of London the player takes the role of a crime gang member who wants to take control over London. The basic gameplay premise reminds of the GTA series but instead of a free roaming experience the campaign consists of 70 short missions which are chosen through a menu screen. Every of them is accompanied with a story sequence in a comic style and features varied goals: escorting, infiltrating an enemy post, stealing cars, kidnapping people, racing, defending the own position against enemy waves and killing people.

The gameplay itself offers what one would expect from a game like this: if the player is on foot the game is basically a third person shooter - sometimes he has a few other gang members with him and can give them a few commands. The driving is action oriented in either first or third person and the stealth segments are basic and require only to perceive the guard's patrols and kill them from behind. The police intervenes if they see a crime but there is no wanted system like in similar games. At the beginning of the campaign the player has a choice between five gangs with different abilities, e.g. the Triads can drive faster.

Additionally the game features a big selection of playing modes and mini games, e.g. free roaming in London, driving taxi, photographing points of interests as tourist or fighting off zombies. The mini games in the pub can be played with two players: darts, bowling, pool and a Snake variant as arcade machine, The last noteworthy mode is a tactical game similar to Risk: The player takes control over a crime organization and tries to conquer London which is divided into about 30 districts. In every round he can perform three actions, e.g. move men to another district. Between rounds he can hire more men or acquire bonus cards which give certain advantages. There are three difficulty levels and several winning conditions for this mode.</Overview>

The more this meter fills, the more souls he gets from enemies he kills. Souls are used to purchase new moves and extras like additional characters. There are some shielded enemies where you must have a minimum vengeance bar to damage them. There is also a spirit gauge, which is essentially a special meter and is also built up by attacking. It allows the uses of special moves, like your shotgun.

There are also Hellcycle levels, where you must successfully avoid obstacles while destroying enemies with the bike's hellshots attacks and your chains. This version of the game additionally includes a challenge mode which is based on the Hellcycle levels with rule variations: elimination and survival (every racer has a depleting life bar which can be only refilled by driving through checkpoints).</Overview>

    <Name>GhostBusters : The Video Game</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-10-30T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>An official sequel to the two Ghostbusters movies, Ghostbusters: The Video Game puts the player in control of Rookie, the unnamed newest member of the Ghostbusters. Shortly after being hired a mysterious ghostly shock wave flows through New York City, prompting the Ghostbusters to begin an investigation. Over the course of the game they will return to many locations from the movies and meet returning characters as well as some new locations and characters.

As the Rookie the player must explore levels to find and capture any ghosts while being assisted by fellow Ghostbusters following you. A ghost must first be weakened using any of the proton pack weapon modes it is vulnerable to, then by dragging the stunned ghost to a trap placed by the player or their teammates. Other enemy types must be defeated by first revealing a weak point and then pulling it out with the proton pack's blast stream, or by simply dealing enough damage to the enemy. If the Rookie takes too much damage themselves they will be knocked unconscious, and their allies will attempt to get to them and help them back up. The Rookie can do the same if any of their allies are knocked unconscious, and if all current members of the team are knocked down the game will return to the last checkpoint. Information about enemies and objects in the world can be obtained by scanning them, and concept art for the entries can be added by finding hidden pages in the levels. The Rookie receives upgrades to their proton pack automatically over the course of the game, and by finding enough scanner entries they can increase their health.</Overview>

    <Name>GI Joe: The Rise of Cobra</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-08-04T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra is based off of the 2009 blockbuster movie, but features a brand new storyline that differs from the movie where an elite group of soldiers must fight against the diabolical Cobra Commander and stop his organization known as Cobra from taking over the world.

The gameplay is similar to Neo Contra with a behind the back view where the player uses a variety of weapons including machine guns and rocket launchers and the Delta 6 Accelerator Suit that makes the player invulnerable for a short period of time. Using these weapons and accessories the player must fight his way through a horde of enemies including soldiers, tanks and jet fighters, along with the standard end of level bosses.

The player can choose from 12 different Joes, but only a certain set at the beginning and unlocking more for completing missions, each with their own weapon and strengths depending upon their rank (Commandos are great at close range, Heavy Weapons are good at shooting from long distances while Soldiers are a mix of both), along with using various vehicles scattered throughout the stages. The game also features a two-player drop-in/drop-out co-op option that allows a friend to join a game at any time, however during gameplay without a human ally, the computer's A.I. will take over for the second on-screen soldier.</Overview>

    <Overview>Gift is a story that revolves around high school student Amami Haruhiko and his strong connection to Gift's mysterious power.

The town of Narasaki-chou, where Gift's story takes place, has two distinguishing characteristics: a rainbow that seems permanently fixed in the sky no matter the weather, and an ability known as Gift possessed by all its inhabitants. Gift's power can only be evoked by each person once in a lifetime, and is able to grant a single miracle. To be successful, a Gift must reflect the shared feelings of both the giver and the receiver. If the feelings are not mutual, the Gift is distorted and has the ability to wreak havoc on the surrounding area. When this happens, a black streak appears in the rainbow above town until Gift is used correctly.

The story begins as Haruhiko's younger sister, Fukamine Riko, returns home after several years away. Beginning with her appearance, Haruhiko's life starts to change very quickly and feelings of the past begin to surface once more.</Overview>

    <Name>Gitaroo Man Lives!</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2006-11-14T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>U-1 is an ordinary boy who dreams about becoming an excellent skateboarder to impress Pico, the girl of his dreams. Little does U-1 know that he is the last descendant of Gitaroo Man, an incredible superhero with the power to battle foes with his magical guitar. It's up to you, as U-1, to vanquish the villains and win the girl as Gitaroo Man!

Gitaroo Man Lives! is an enhanced remake of Gitaroo Man for the PS2. You take the role of U-1, and fight enemies by playing your guitar. There are multiple phases of battle in Gitaroo Man Lives! The first is the Charge phase - during this phase, you must tilt the Analog Stick in the direction that an on-screen line shows, as well as holding the Circle Button when prompted. The better you do here, the more power you will have to fight with for the Battle Phase. In this phase, you alternate between Attacking (similar to Charge Phase), and Guarding (press the appropriate buttons as they appear on-screen to block attacks.) Success in these two phases will lead you into the Final Phase, where you must finish off your enemy.

Gitaroo Man Lives! is also compatible with Ad Hoc Mode for multiplayer play. Up to two players can play, either choosing to fight against each other in VS Mode, or to play co-operatively in the PSP exclusive Duet Mode. In this mode, all-new songs have been created for two players to battle with.</Overview>

    <Name>God of War: Chains of Olympus</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2008-03-04T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The game is set in Ancient Greece and loosely based on its mythology. The player controls Kratos, a Spartan warrior in the service of the Olympian Gods. Kratos is guided by the goddess Athena, who instructs him to find the Sun God Helios, as the Dream God Morpheus has caused the remaining gods to slumber in Helios' absence. With the power of the sun, Morpheus and Persephone, the Queen of the Underworld, with the aid of the Titan Atlas, intend to destroy the Pillar of the World and in turn Olympus. God of War: Chains of Olympus is chronologically the second chapter in the series, which focuses on vengeance as its central theme.

Chains of Olympus is a prequel set ten years before the original God of War. Gameplay is similar to the predecessors but with some minor changes. Kratos goes through levels killing enemies and bosses, solving box-based puzzles and doing quick time events. He also collects red orbs to power up his weapons and abilities, Gorgon eyeballs to increase his health and Phoenix feathers to increase his magic power.

The game's controls were adjusted to fit the PSP's reduced amount of buttons. Both the shoulder buttons and the analog stick are now required in order to dodge. The most well-known God of War weapon, the Blades of Chaos, are also present. There are several new weapons and magic spells available, including Sun Shield, Efreet spell and Light of Dawn. The game starts when the Gods send Kratos to the city of Attica to defend it from the invading Persian army. But later when Morpheus strikes, Kratos will need to use all his power to save the world once again.</Overview>

    <Overview>The game is centered on an open-ended design. The single-player menu presents players with three variables — Mode Selection (Time Trial, Single Race, and Drift Trial), Car Selection, and Track Selection. The player can pick and choose circuits and vehicles, with credits earned based on the difficulty, performance and number of laps they have chosen. Players can select from any number of laps, one to 99. There are 45 tracks (including layout variations) plus the added bonus of reverse on most tracks, which takes the track number close to 75. For the first time in the series, the game features the use of custom soundtracks that enables players to play their own songs while racing, but this option must first be unlocked by completing section B of the Driving Challenges. The music tracks can only be played if it is set on "MUSIC folder" and can be used for offline or online races.</Overview>

    <Name>greenTech+</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-01-26T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>greenTech+ is a commercial version of the freeware game greenTech. Just like in the original game the player controls a hurricane in an attempt to steer polluted clouds into cleansing factories, to create cleaner air and thwart global warming. Polluted clouds are sent out gradually and these are drawn towards the hurricane that can move about freely on the screen. By moving the hurricane and keeping track of all pollution, the clouds need to be steered into the factories. Borrowing from the mechanics of Tower Defense games, the pollution needs to be moved away from high pressure zones. These zones immediately absorb the pollution and disperse it, adding 10% to the global warming percentage. Similarly, having pollution touch the hurricane yields a 20% percentage. When 100% is reached, Earth is destroyed and the game is over.

The game consists of 30 levels that are unlocked in six tiers, along with a tutorial. New tiers become available by collecting perfect clear ribbons; clearing stages with 0% percentage. The game has a retro look and all levels are played in single, non-scrolling screens. In later levels multiple pollution appears at once and it often needs to be guided through small passages. Two additional keys allow the player to speed up or speed down the pollution, but this does not affect the entire game time. By completing levels players unlock monitors that give the game a different look. The game also supports anaglyph 3D.

Compared to the mechanics of the first game, the hurricane is no longer restricted to a grid and can be moved around freely at a much faster pace compared to the mouse-based controls in the original game.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2005-10-04T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Gretzky NHL 06 for PSP is a hockey game endorsed by legendary player Wayne Gretzky. Released only six months after the previous PSP game, this version comes with updated rosters and several features taken from the PS2 version, but has its own selection of modes.

Returning modes include single games and a full season. The new chemistry feature makes its way over from the PS2, influencing players' stats depending on how well they interact with each other. Also seen on the PS2 is the "Wayne vs Wayne" mode, in which the two competing teams build up their "99 meter". When full, The Great One himself joins the team as an extra player for a short time. In addition to single games, this mode can also be played in the PSP-exclusive NHL Showdown mode, which is a ladder against all NHL teams, with the finale against a team of five Gretzkys. Another exclusive mode is called "3 on 3 Countdown". It is an arcade mode, with only three players per team on the field, without any of the regular rules, and the winner being the team that reaches a set score first.

Online multiplayer, both ad hoc and via infrastructure, also return, as do the Gretzky Challenges: by earning points through in-game achievements, players can unlock bonuses like alternate and vintage uniforms and new gameplay features and modes. Unlike the previous PSP game, Gretzky 06 features color and play-by-play commentary by Mike Emrick and Darren Pang.</Overview>

    <Overview>Gripshift is a driving game with a twist. It combines racing with puzzles and even some platform action.

The game is built around a tour mode where the player must complete the stages one by one. Clear these stages by driving fast to the finish or try to top the times required to obtain bronze, silver, and gold medals. There are also stars to collect and a hidden item on every stage to discover. All of the levels are afloat in the air, so if the player happens to drift off the course, the car drops into nothingness.

There are many multiplayer modes, including bonus games such as soccer, ice hockey and a Snake game played with cars. In the track editor, players can construct their own gravity-defying tracks and share them through a wireless connection.</Overview>

    <Overview>Mihama Academy - on the surface, a closed learning environment established to nurture students who find themselves at odds with the world around them; in actuality, an orchard-cum-prison built to preserve fruit that has fallen too far from its tree. Whatever the circumstances behind its establishment, Mihama Academy is at present home to five female students, all with their own reasons for "enrollment." For better or worse, each girl has established a routine obliging of her current situation; life moves at an idle, yet accommodating pace within the walls of Mihama. Yet with the arrival of the institute's first male student, the nearly preposterously opaque Kazami Yuuji, the students at Mihama begin to fall out of step with their predetermined rhythms. Will Yuuji prove to be the element the girls around him needed to take hold of their lives once more, or will the weight of their pasts prove too steep a wall to overcome? And in the first place, just who is Kazami Yuuji? While the true nature of the "job" he is wont to alight to at the most haphazard of moments remains shrouded in secrecy, one thing is for certain - his encroachment upon the quiet orchard known as Mihama Academy will prove itself momentous in one way or another. And of course, one cannot discount the possibility that perhaps Yuuji himself carries the weightiest past of any of the students...</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2010-07-12T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Groovin' Blocks is a falling block-type puzzle game with gameplay that has been likened to Columns and Lumines. The game sees players having to clear lines of three or more blocks of the same color, and like Columns players can cycle through the falling lines of blocks, with adjacent blocks of the same color also disappearing with the matched lines. In addition, extra points can be scored when players bring their falling blocks down to the downbeats (called "Superbeats") of the game's electronica soundtrack, adding to a score multiplier.

By setting high scores, players collect stars to unlock new songs and power-ups. Unlike most puzzle games which are played to infinity, each stage in Groovin' Blocks lasts for the duration of the song if the player has not yet failed the stage by filling their play area with blocks.</Overview>

Scattered reports from the Villtanian refugees who have fled the country dribble in and the world is hearing a horror-filled tale of devastation by monsters and biological experiments summoned for war and world domination by Villtania's leading scholar and self-described sorcerer, Raimond. The once beautiful Villtanian countryside now runs red with the blood of its people. The United Nations have declared an international emergency and while unable to commit any of the world's armies to this strange, supernatural conflict, they have offered a huge reward to any hot-shot mercenaries or hunters brave enough to take on theses monsters from another dimension and restore order to Villtania.

    <Name>Gungnir</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2012-06-12T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>In a land ravaged by disparity where the impoverished must battle for survival, the fate of all is thrust into uncertainty when rebels happen upon custody of a young female noble and a magical spear of immeasurable power falls from the heavens. Now, hunted by incumbent powers desperate to reclaim the girl and armed with a weapon capable of reshaping the realm, the Resistance must wage war to deliver themselves from the tyranny of their oppressors.
As original as its narrative, Gungnir's strategy RPG mechanics offer a number of fresh twists on an expertly honed formula. Building upon the traditional action queue of turn-based strategy RPGs, actions in Gungnir all have a numerical wait interval associated with them. Faster actions bear smaller numbers, allowing them to precede slower preexisting attacks. Should the player wish, they may sacrifice tactical points, which afford them more combat options, in order to accelerate actions. This classic balance of risk and reward, a staple of Sting titles, enriches the Gungnir's deep strategic battles and gives the player far more critical decisions to weigh.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2007-02-12T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Gurumin: A Monstrous Adventure is a 3D platform game with an emphasis on action and platforming with puzzle elements. It stars a 12 year old girl named Parin who needs to move in with her grandfather, the mayor of a mining town called Tiese, as her parents go overseas on an excavation. Parin felt fine about moving in with her grandfather until she hears that she is the only kid in the town and has nobody to play with. Nonetheless her grandfather suggests that she goes exploring the town and stopping by to see Fan, the woman who runs the town bakery, to see if she can be friends with her.

After visiting the shops and exploring what little Tiese has to offer, Parin is surprised to find a girl being attacked by a stray dog. Parin hurries to rescue the girl but quickly finds out that the girl she rescued is actually not a girl at all, but a monster named Pino. Parin is then taken through a hidden entrance near her house by Pino and her brother, Puku, where she meets the rest of monsters in Monster Village and finally finds some friends to play with. Unfortunately, soon after Puku is kidnapped by evil creatures called phantoms and it's up to Parin to rescue him, so the other monsters provide her with the only weapon they have, a legendary drill.

As Parin makes her way through the first dungeon to rescue Puku, the phantoms attack Monster Village which puts the whole world at risk. It is now up to Parin to make her way through more dungeons to restore Monster Village and save the world.

Parin's drill has four power levels that build as she fights, or at restoration points, and the decreases as she receives damage. Parin can also equip accessories that have various abilities such as increasing defense or giving her a larger numbers of coins as she defeats enemies. Coins and junk are two forms of currency in the game that are used to acquire and upgrade accessories or learn new attacks. Coins can be found easily in pots or are dropped by enemies, however junk can only be acquired when dropped by enemies that were carrying an item such as a shield.</Overview>

    <Overview>When her father fell sick, Asagi Haru has to help support her family. She quits her job at the factory and starts looking for a new job. That’s when she bumpes into Egawa Chitomi and Arita Kisuke, who are looking for a new maid for the Miyanomori family. Haru applied for the job on the spot, leaving her hometown to work in their mansion in Tokyo. She thought working as a maid would be fun.. until she meets the six Miyanomori brothers.

The brothers each have different mothers, all divorced from their father — the head of the family, Miyanomori Genichirou. Being born in a big family, most of the brothers treat Haru like crap. They call her trash and view her as a lowly servant who doesn’t have any right to talk back to them. Not to mention Tae, her new tsundere friend there, keeps lying and gets her in trouble. Haru quickly realized that her new job isn’t by any means easy, but she needs to work hard for her family.

Not too long after Haru starts working there, Genichirou announced to his sons that he’s retiring soon and he’s making a game to determine who will be the next head. The brothers have to entertain him and collect points. The first one who reached ten points will be the new head, and they have until March to please their father. This is the reason why the brothers all have different mothers: Genichirou wants to put them into a battle for the position.</Overview>

    <Overview>In Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince the Video Game, Voldemort is tightening his grip on both the Muggle and wizarding worlds and Hogwarts is no longer the safe haven it once was. Harry suspects that dangers may even lie within the castle, but Dumbledore is more intent upon preparing him for the final battle that he knows is fast approaching. Together they work to find the key to unlock Voldemort’s defenses and, to this end, Dumbledore recruits his old friend and colleague, the well-connected and unsuspecting bon vivant Professor Horace Slughorn, whom he believes holds crucial information.

Meanwhile, the students are under attack from a very different, but equally unavoidable adversary as teenage hormones rage across the ramparts. Harry finds himself more and more drawn to Ginny, but so is Dean Thomas. And Lavender Brown has decided that Ron is the one for her, only she hadn't counted on Romilda Vane’s chocolates. And then there’s Hermione, simmering with jealously, but determined not to show her feelings. Yet as romance blossoms throughout Hogwarts, one student remains aloof. He is determined to make his mark, albeit a dark one. Love is in the air, but tragedy lies ahead and Hogwarts may never be the same again.</Overview>

    <Overview>Harvest Moon: Hero of Leaf Valley, like Harvest Moon: Save the Homeland before it, is a little different from the other Harvest Moon games because instead of starting a farm from scratch, you start with a fully functional, albeit deserted and overgrown, farm and have to keep it from being destroyed. It is your grandfather's farm but he has died and your father wants to sell the land to the Funland Corporation. They intend to bulldoze the place and turn it into an amusement park. That's not what Grandpa Gus worked for all his life, so you decide to take over the farm that has fallen into disarray a bit and make it profitable again. You have two years to raise $50,000. The gameplay is very similar to previous titles: grow and sell crops, raise animals, mine ores, befriend the neighbours and perhaps even find a wife.</Overview>

    <Overview>As the game is a rhythm game, players are allowed to choose from a wide variety of Vocaloid songs, original songs sung by vocaloids, including songs sung by Hatsune Miku, Kagamine Rin and Len.

    <ReleaseDate>2010-07-29T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The game primarily uses the same gameplay mechanics from the original game albeit with several changes. Most notable of which is that the game now uses the D-pad (arrow buttons) and a "hold and release" function for the face buttons in addition to the normal gameplay. Similar to the symbols of the first game, the game now includes colored arrows for example a blue arrow pointing downwards, this indicates that the player has to press "down" on the D-Pad and the "Cross" face button at the same time. The game also add a fourth difficulty, Extreme, to songs that is more difficult than the hard difficulty in the first game. The game will also introduce duets, as compared to only having solo songs in the first game, thus allowing players to select two modules instead. This also carries on into the Edit Mode of the game allowing players to create PVs for duets with two modules in them.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2007-05-24T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Heatseeker is an arcade aerial blaster in which the player flies nearly 40 fully-licensed modern jet fighters at supersonic speeds, firing huge numbers of missiles at vast numbers of enemy planes, tanks, ships, cruise missiles and anything else that looks in need of being taught a lesson. It features the ImpactCam, which lets you watch the effects of your destruction up close and personal, avoiding the long-distance 'blip killing' often found in other flight games.

Players take on the role of pilot, Mike 'Downtown' Hudson, who flies for the International Council's Air Force. A dictator has launched a terrorist attack - you are part of the response to fight sea and airborne enemies in an attempt to avert an international crisis. Missions take place on locations all over the world.

Heatseeker's arcade presentation includes infinite ammo, huge kill counts, a colourful, saturated look, and over-the-top characters and scenarios.</Overview>

    <Name>Hellboy: Science of Evil</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2008-06-24T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Hellboy: The Science of Evil is the second game adaptation of Mike Mignola's popular comic book character (now also featured in films and an animated series). The story is unique to the game, and sees Hellboy travel through six different settings as he tracks down the evil Von Klempt. Hellboy faces his familiar enemies including various demons and Nazi creations. The game features brawler style action, with some puzzle and story elements interspersed throughout.

In The Science of Evil, Hellboy has several abilities that set him apart from the standard brawler character, including the ability to pick up and wield many environmental objects such as barrels and debris from structures knocked down with his Right Hand of Doom. He can also grapple enemies to finish them off one-on-one, or use them as projectiles.

Team up with a friend and attempt six co-op multiplayer levels over ad-hoc WiFi. These levels are derived from the single-player campaign, but have been shortened and re-worked to provide a set of two-player puzzles. Scores are tracked individually - so it doesn't have to be completely co-operative.

Hellboy: The Science of Evil was also released on the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, however the PSP version is not a port of that game. The story elements and characters are similar, but the PSP features a unique combat system, different AI and a new level layout more suited to the handheld environment.</Overview>

    <Name>Hello Kitty: Puzzle Party</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-05-28T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Hello Kitty: Puzzle Party is a collection of puzzle games featuring Sanrio's ubiquitous Hello Kitty character. There are three games included:
Jigsaw Puzzle is, as the name suggests, a standard jigsaw puzzle mode. The pieces come oriented properly, so the player only needs to place them in the correct spot. There are two difficulty levels: easy puzzles have 24 pieces, while hard puzzles have 48 pieces.

Picture Perfect is a nonogram puzzle much like Picross. Using the numbers at the top and left as hints, the player must mark the proper squares to create a picture. There are three difficulty levels; the higher the level, the larger the puzzle.

Tasty Tidbits is a falling-block puzzle very similar to Puyo Puyo. Kitty heads and fruits drop in pairs from the top of the screen and must be arranged. Connect four pieces of the same color, including at least one fruit, and they will be cleared. Easy mode starts the player at level 1, while hard mode starts the player at level 11.
All of the mini-games unlock pictures and parts for the Hello Kitty Gadget, a clock &amp; calendar featuring dozens of Hello Kitty illustrations. The design mode lets the player choose from any of the parts unlocked from the mini-games.</Overview>

    <Name>Hexyz Force</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2010-06-02T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>One side of Berge was bathed in constant light, and is known as Lustrous Berge. The other half is cloaked in constant darkness, and is known as Dark Berge. A miasma-filled chasm called the Black Precipice divides the two halves and has been in place for so long that most residents of the world don’t even know that the other half exists... And now, events loom that threaten both halves of the world. Fate has chosen a champion from each half, and now, the player must choose which champion to play as. The stage has been set. Will it be the best of times, or the worst of times?

In Hexyz Force, players choose one of the two main characters, either young priestess Cecilia "Ceci" Armaclite or veteran knight Levant von Schweitzer. Both paths tell different parts of the story, so the game is effectively two RPGs in one. Combat is initiated on the field map, but much like another Atlus PSP title, battles can be avoided by dodging the enemies on the field.

If combat is entered, the game turns into a standard turn-based RPG, but with a rock-paper-scissors elemental system called the Divine Aspects. Each weapon is linked to an element, and if the attacks follow the proper pattern, a damage gauge will build that will multiply the damage once the chain breaks. Both the enemy and the player have access to the gauge, so the enemy can use it to unload huge damage onto the player.

As is the case with most Sting RPGs, weapons are destructible items. The game also has a weapon crafting and fusion system that replaces shops. Players get components to create items from battle or by collecting them from Harvest Points that are spread around the world.</Overview>

    <Overview>Higurashi Daybreak is a team based beat'em up game for up to four players.

One day when Rika was sweeping the stairs outside the Furude shrine a box containing a pair of magical magatama (viewers of the anime will recognize them from the last episode of Higurashi no naku Koro ni Rei) fell from the sky and hit her in the head. Rika brings them to school and after the club tested them on Chie and Irie they decide to battle for the ownership of the magatama and soon the whole village is involved. Each character has two special weapons that is associated with the character in the anime and/or the early visual novel games (Keiichi has his baseball bat and Rena has of course her meat cleaver).

The game features story mode and "combat mode". In story mode there are three story lines (and teams) available from the start and four more to unlock. In "combat mode" you select which characters that should battle and then set up environment and game options and then it's fight on.</Overview>

    <Overview>Himawari tells a tale of love, tragedy, and sacrifice played out on two stages – Earth, and outer space. Enter Hinata Youichi, a young high school student and sole survivor of a tragic spaceplane crash that robbed him of both his family and memories roughly two years prior. Amnesiac but steady in his new life, Youichi manages to find solace in surrounding himself with friends: Amamiya Ginga, the eccentric son of a world-famous astronaut, as well as the tomboyish, yet ultimately kind-hearted quasi-childhood friend, Saionji Asuka. Everything changes, however, when an unidentified object crash-lands in Youichi’s hometown and he meets Aries, a mysterious – and similarly amnesiac – young girl from outer space. Who is Aries? What happened on that fateful day two years ago? And what secrets lurk behind the accident that turned Youichi’s life upside down?

Explore Youichi’s struggle in coming to terms with his lost memories while an entirely different story is revealed to have taken place far beyond the clouds, in the chilling void of outer space. What starts out as a young man’s light-hearted high-school adventure soon takes a more serious turn as both Youichi and the reader are led to face a sobering revelation: that not everything is as it seems at first glance.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2011-03-21T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The name says it all: the player controls a dragon, preying upon a medieval/fantasy kingdom in one of four game modes, laying waste to knights and castles and kidnapping princesses (for ransom!), all in the pursuit of more shiny shiny to decorate hoard sweet hoard with.

Maps are based on user selections, with geographical particularities randomized within those parameters. The player controls the dragon with two thumbsticks, one to fly and one to direct a stream of cleansing fire emerging from the dragon's mouth -- over crops, windmills, merchant carts, archers and all sorts of targets. Winnow your target down to extinction after a few fiery gasps and all that is left in their wake is a small mound of treasure, to be collected and returned to the dragon's home base on the map, its hoard, where players can heal and upgrade one of four abilities -- Speed, Breath, Treasure Capacity, and Armor -- when not defending their gold-pile from thieves and driving off would-be princess-rescuing knights.

Game modes include Treasure Hunt (a drive to maximise income in a set time limit), Princess Rush (striving to reach a set number of Princess ransoms), Survival (see how long you can survive) and Co-op.</Overview>

    <Overview>Everybody's Tennis is basically a port of Everybody's Tennis on PlayStation 2 but with several gameplay additions, for example a story: the player has the mission to bring the "Happy Tennis Club" to world fame. He walks through the tennis grounds and other locations, talks to people and of course plays matches to progress the plot.

Victories and other accomplishments reward experience points which improve the athlete's abilities like stamina or accuracy. New are many clothes and accessories which also give certain benefits and can be purchased with prize money.

The game itself is very arcade oriented which means the player only needs to the correct position to the ball and a good timing. The player also can choose between different shot variants by pressing the assigned buttons.

    <Name>Hot Wheels: Ultimate Racing</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2007-07-02T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Ultimate Racing is the first game in the series of Hot Wheels licensees to appear on the PSP platform. Just like the other games, it is a straightforward racing game with a focus on arcade gameplay. The game offers three game modes:
Ultimate Challenge: win races to unlock new cars, tracks, challenges and performance upgrades.

Arcade Mode: quick play based on the unlocked content from the Ultimate Challenge mode.

Multiplayer Mode: quick races or checkpoint-based races for up to four players
In Ultimate Challenge, there are six main stages to choose from, with eleven tracks and twenty licensed cars in total. The game starts from a central warehouse where all unlocked cars are stored. These can be upgraded or customized in the garage. Next to the performance upgrades, players can tweak the colors of the body, glass, neon, wheels, and change the wheels and decals.

The Arcade Mode is further divided into different challenges: Quick Race, Survival Mode (complete a series of increasingly difficult races and avoid being kicked out), Collector (checkpoint-based races) and Time Trial.

Next to regular racing controls such as brakes and acceleration, players can also use NOS (boost) and Slow Motion (slow down time during difficult sections). The use is limited as it depletes a reserve. It can be refilled by passing by obstacles without hitting them or completing tricky jumps. Tracks, with themes such as Volcano, Jungle or Death Valley, are generally filled with obstacles, moving objects or animals. The focus is entirely on racing, there are no weapons or other offensive means and the cars can only be slowed down, unable to sustain damage.

There are three different camera settings and ghost cars are supported during time trials.</Overview>

    <Overview>It sucks when you're hungry. Sometimes you just want to bury your face into a burger, or tear into a taco. Out on the African savannah, a Hungry Giraffe feels your pain.

A 20 foot tall, 1200kg animal like the giraffe needs to chow down on tons of food each day, just to stay alive. But, oh no! All the tastiest leaves have been eaten, while up in the sky endless quantities of snacks, fruit and junk food hover just out of reach!

Hungry Giraffe features the world's largest and hungriest even-toed ungulate. Through skilful steering of his neck, you can propel your half-starved giraffe on his twisty-turny upward journey, chomping on strawberries, fries, sandwiches and naughtier treats.

But beware! The skies are also strewn with hazards. Poison, Anvils and non-prescription Drugs also hover up there, ready to send unwary giraffes plummeting to earth.

Hungry Giraffe is by FAR the greatest giraffe-feeding game of all time! Dare you miss out?</Overview>

    <Name>I.Q Mania</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2006-03-09T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>In this surreal game your human avatar stands alone on a platform of blocks facing an army of grey, black, and green cubes (or qubes). As groups of cubes begin an ominous lurching roll in your direction, you must capture each cube (with the exception of the black ones) or be crushed.

You capture a single cube by lighting a square at your feet, allowing a cube to roll over it, and then activating that lit square. The activated square removes the cube from play. With a bit of planning, you can use special cubes to set off sequences of lit squares that can then capture many cubes at once.

If any cube rolls off the end of the platform, however, or you capture a black cube, the platform on which you're standing gets a little shorter. Should you get pushed off the end of the platform, you will fall into the black abyss, and to your doom. When your game ends you are assigned a high score, appropriately called an IQ.

This entry in the Intelligent Qube series is essentially a compilation, including over 7000 levels selected from the three earlier games in the series (Intelligent Qube, IQ Final and I.Q. Remix), including 100 Attack modes and a new Survival mode. Next to regular ad-hoc multiplayer, Sony also introduced a new form of game sharing. I.Q. Mania was released at the same time as the puzzlers XI Coliseum and Bakufuu Sentai Bombermen. If you own one of these games and a friend has one as well, you can play multiplayer games for any of them simply by connecting. Each game also includes a demo for the other two games and five multiplayer minigames: Bowling, Kunoichi Densetsu, Double Smash , N.U.M. and Party x Party x Party.</Overview>

    <Name>Impossible Mission</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2007-08-31T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>In six hours the evil Professor Elvin Atombender's nuclear missiles will launch and destroy strategic locations on the earth. Only one agent can infiltrate his secret base and undertake this Impossible Mission.

The goal of Impossible Mission is to acquire nine passwords and bring these to Atombender's Control Room in time to shut down the rockets. Unfortunately these passcodes (contained on punch cards) have been broken into four pieces each, and each piece hidden in computers, furniture, and waste bins throughout the base. On top of that Atombender has an entire army of robots patrolling the base. If a robot touches or shocks the agent then ten minutes are removed from the clock and the room is reset. The agent can jump over robots, but the only way to stop them is to expend a specific item on a room's computer terminal, and even that only disables them for a few seconds.

The 2007 release of the game has a few improvements over the original version, mostly to improve the graphics and make the game easier. The player can select one of three agents, although all of them possess the same abilities. Robots are now color coded according to what they are capable of doing (yellow only patrol, red patrol and shock, blue can follow and shock), but some aspects of each robot's personality can still only be figured out by watching or approaching them. Finally an easy mode has been added that adds an extra two hours to the clock and marks rooms which you have cleared out of items. The original mode with the original graphics can also be played, as well as a "mixed" mode that uses the old avatar graphics, makes all robots the same color, but keeps any other graphical upgrades.</Overview>

    <Name>Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-06-09T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The PSP release of Indiana Jones and the Staff of Kings is a trimmed-down rendition of the PS2/Wii versions and also different from the Nintendo DS release. The general storyline is the same, as it is set in 1939 just before World War II begins. Indiana Jones is in search of the Staff of Moses, even though that is not the main quest until halfway through the game. It starts in a Mayan ruin where Charles Kingston takes Jones to the resting place of the jade sphere, a Mayan astronomy guide. Another colleague, Magnus Völler, strikes out on his own and quickly runs into trouble. The sphere becomes a bone of contention when the story picks up a few years later when Jones is in San Francisco. He receives a call from Archie Tan who is hunted down by the Chinese who also hold his granddaughter Suzy captive. Jones has to infiltrate Chinatown and rescue both. The sphere then brings him to Panama and eventually also Nepal. The importance of the Staff of Moses is only gradually revealed, as well as Magnus Völler as the main villain.

The game consists of a series of very different action sequences with scripted events, a lot of fighting and minor elements of puzzle solving. Generally Indy is able to fight melee combat using a number of punches and combos, use a pistol and a whip, and manipulate the environment. Many items such as bottles, spears or chairs can be picked up to be used as weapons, while certain items also need to be manipulated to retrieve clues, open valves or lower platforms. Often there are maze-like level layouts and a limited time frame to complete them.

There are hidden artifacts to collect, and a number of primary and secondary goals that provide Glory and Fortune points. These can be spent to upgrade Indy's abilities (such as additional health, stronger defence or tougher punches) or to unlock concept art or cheats.</Overview>

    <Name>Infected</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2005-11-15T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Infected is a fast-paced third person comedy zombie shooter. The focus is on a humorous plot and combo-based zombie killing.

It's Christmas time in New York and Zombies have come to ruin the festivities. As New York Cop Agent Stevens, you find out that not only are you immune to the zombie virus, but your blood is actually so powerful, it will make a zombie explode.

The main focus of the gameplay is shooting holes in the zombies until they are weak enough for you to fire a vial of your own blood into them, causing an explosion. Weaken enough zombies, fire a blood vial into one, and watch the chain reaction as exploding zombies send your anti-zombie blood onto other zombies.

The game was one of the first online PSP games, and featured a mode where defeating an opponent would give them your virus, and force their avatar online to look like your avatar. If they in turn defeated someone, your virus would be passed onto them as well. At any time you could look at a world map to see where on earth your strain of virus had travelled.</Overview>

    <Name>Innocent Life: A Futuristic Harvest Moon</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2007-05-15T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Innocent Life: A Futuristic Harvest Moon is a new generation of the Harvest Moon series. Unlike all previous games the only thing the player is able to choose when starting the game is the name of the main character. The game takes place in the year of 2022 on a small island located in the southern hemisphere. The player is not cast as human teenager as in previous games, but as a brand new robot - created by Dr. Hopes from in Volcano Town. This time it is not possible to marry for instance. The main goal is to save the island from destruction by angry spirits of nature. To do so, the robot will learn how to develop more human characteristics.

Much has changed in terms of how the game plays out compared to other entries in the series. Many of these changes are improvements as well as fixes to over-exploited tricks in the previous titles. One of the major improvements to game is the ability to walk through crops that have been planted. Seeds are now planted in 1x1 squares as opposed to the old 9x9 method of planting. Seeds are now also purchased in individual numbers as opposed to bags of 9. Crops and flowers are no longer destroyed if players accidentally drop them on the ground for some time. Things grown in the wild cannot longer be exploited. Instead a special “Scale Pack” is required to harvest them and only 3kg can be carried at all times.

Crops grown in the wild are no longer available every single day of the season. Like in real life they now have specific “regrowth” periods as well as specific schedules on which the fruits or other things are fully grown and able to be harvested. Time no longer stops when inside a farm, but it stops when other people's houses are entered. The entire field is no longer available right at the start of the game. It needs to be increased by unlocking the seals on it. Gems to unlock them come from the story quests and the exploration of caves. The time hierarchy has also been changed. Players can now choose to get up earlier than usual, but only if the character goes to sleep before 21:00 (11:00 PM).</Overview>

    <Overview>Invizimals allows players to interact with their environment, using the PSP Camera to look for invisible creatures that lurk around every corner.

    <Name>Iron Man</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2008-05-02T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Mostly based on the 2008 movie Iron Man, this videogame of the one-man-army hero has been released for seven different platforms.

The game of Iron Man puts you under the skin of Tony Stark. He is a billionaire weapon-industrialist and genius inventor who, after being kidnapped by terrorists who want to force him to build weapons for them, builds an armor instead to escape. Since then, he decided to stop producing weapons and keeps on working on the suit to fight them back.

The games take the story further, giving the player the chance to go through more than 12 different missions and even fight villains that do not appear on the movie, like Whiplash and Titanium Man. All this is shown through cinematics between every mission and use the voices of actors of the movie like Robert Downey Jr. and Terrence Howard.

By foot or by air, with the first armor at the beginning and in the characteristic red and gold suit later, using range weapons or melee attacks, the game features Stark fighting with armies of soldiers, tanks, helicopters, canons, etc. with the help of an array of upgradeable weapons like missiles, micro-grenades, repulsive shots, EMP blasts, a flame thrower and the powerful "Unibeam". Both the weapons and the suit (propulsion and armor systems) are upgradeable, and there are many special armors from the comics to unlock in most of the versions.

Differences in this version from the Xbox360/PS3 version consist of altered visuals and altered upgrade system (rather than spending money on them, the player's gear is upgraded based on how much it has been used).</Overview>

    <Name>Iron Man 2</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2010-05-04T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Sega returns players to the technologically empowered role of Tony Stark, for another third-person action-adventure through the Marvel universe. Iron Man 2 is based on the 2010 feature film and released alongside its theatrical debut. Following the style of the publisher's original movie-based Iron Man game, the sequel features high-speed flight sequences, high-powered weaponry, and challenging battles against outnumbering forces and formidable supervillain characters.

The control scheme has been refined from the original game, with developers taking player feedback into consideration. Iron Man can perform new martial arts moves in the sequel, allowing players to engage in hands-on combat with powerful bosses.The game's environments are more completely destructible, creating new offensive possibilities as well as defensive concerns. Additional weapons become available to help players meet these new challenges.

The game's story was authored by comic book writer Matt Fraction, and combines plot elements from the film with Iron Man comic book lore. In a side plot not featured in the movie, the hero fights his regular comic book rival, the battle-suited Crimson Dynamo. High-stakes challenges threaten ultimate defeat through each chapter of action, and the game concludes with the fate of the entire world once again in the weapon-clad hands of the invincible Iron Man.</Overview>

    <Name>Isle of Minno</Name>
    <ReleaseYear>2006</ReleaseYear>
    <Overview>sle of Minno was developed for the Playstation Portable in 2006 by Sumo Digital; a company founded by former Infogrames/ Gremlin Interactive employees and which released other PSP games such as Toca Race Driver, Outrun and Driver 76 (which I truly enjoyed to play when I owned a PSP myself).

There is little information on Isle of Minno, a prototype was found by an Assembler Games Forum user and the game itself looks and sounds a bit like a children’s game. I couldn’t find a reason why the game got cancelled by Sumo Digital; the game is hardly mentioned anywhere. Game also doesn’t show up on old cached webpages of Sumo Digital’s website. In May 2006 Sony and Sumo Digital made some actual pre-production Isle of Minno UMDs, none intended for resale, but you can now easily find a leaked ISO online.

Some of the actual UMD copies even ended up on ebay and were selling for around $ 100. The dumped prototype looks to be a fully playable demo, with even a multiplayer and game sharing option.

The game starts off  with a small sequence showing a boy who washes up ashore on an island after drifting in the sea with some leftovers from a ship. After a small walk on the beach he enters a cave and finds a small village hidden in a valley at the end, presumably called Leafy Cove. After a short introduction talk from an elder person you are sent on your first mission to get yourself some decent clothes. The town is fully explorable; decent sized with loads of places to go to and now and then you find  inhabitants with which you can interact and accept missions from. After completion of a mission you’re invited over to the person’s house or you can collect a small reward for your efforts. The whole gameplay mainly seems to consist of completing small mini games like collecting feathers, fruit or other stuff, mowing lawns, throwing things out threes and of some music memory games.  The complete story of the game or its missions stays however vague.</Overview>

    <Name>James Cameron's Avatar: The Game</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-12-07T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>James Cameron's Avatar: The Game for PSP and Wii shares the setting with the blockbuster movie, but tells a completely different story. A nameless Na’vi warrior, the only survivor of the village destroyed by the RDA (humans), sets on a journey to avenge the death of his people. Along the way he will master his warrior skills, tame a few exotic creatures and find another tribe to accept him as a brother.

This is a 3D action game with an emphasis on stealth. The warrior has two means of attack – a bow and a staff, but there’s not much he can do in an open combat against several soldiers or robots, so he needs to hide behind objects or in the grass and attack stealthily. The warrior collects ‘Eywa spirits’ to upgrade his weapons and the “way of the hunter” – a skill that allows him to stay undetected longer or increase attack strength. There are some flying missions as well. The scrolling is automatic, so the warrior just needs to maneuver on screen avoiding bombs or projectiles and shoot down enemies.</Overview>

    <Overview>It is the 15th century, the time of the Hundred Years' War between England and France. A young French girl from the village of Domremy trying to assist her father with his daily labors discovers a mysterious object: an armlet that binds magically on her wrist. Soon the village is being attacked and finding the first sword she can, she steps forth to encounter the enemy, some humanoid beasts. Taking strength from the armlet, hearing a mysterious voice and having for assistance her close friends, she manages to defeat them and embarks on a long quest to help her countrymen and vanquish the evil forces invading France.

Jeanne d'Arc is a turn-based strategy RPG game of the Japanese variety, that fuses medieval history with fantasy and the craziness of Japanese anime. This is a well known story retold through tactical battles one after another, while game dialog along with hand drawn cutscenes twist the story into different territories from the original.

It is a story of teen friendship and dedication, remorseless war, evil magic, unavoidable death, heartache abandonment and purifying hope. Jeanne joins the army and along with 14 other companions with different skills and personalities march to face England's Henry VI's troops. With her are other armlet wielders, able to use them and transform into fearsome warriors able to strike down evil at its core. The game features a map to move through locations where the battles which push the story forward happen along with free stages that add nothing more than fun, strong items and difficult bosses.</Overview>

    <Overview>Jet de GO! Pocket is the third installment of Taito's flight simulation series for Sony consoles and the first one to be released on PSP. The first title in the series, Jet de GO!, was released on PlayStation in 2000 and its sequel, simply titled "Jet de GO! 2", was released on PlayStation 2 in 2002.

Just like its predecessors, the game allows the player to take the captain's chair in the cockpit of a commercial airliner making flights to and from major Japanese cities such as Tokyo, Osaka and Sapporo. The game features a variety of airplanes such as the Boeing B747, B777 and B767, different weather and daytime conditions and flight plans. The player can choose between three game modes: Flight, Trial and Replay.

Since the game is endorsed by Japan Airlines, a real world airline, it is not actually possible to "crash" an airplane. Collisions with the ground are shown in a simplified fashion where the plane simply stops once it touches down, resulting in a "Game Over" screen.

Although the game was only released in Japan, it features partially English menus.</Overview>

    <Name>Jikandia: The Timeless Land</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-03-15T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>For thousands of years, the people of Jikandia were happy and peaceful, utterly ignorant of the concept of time. Then...one day, uncountable hordes of dangerous creatures appeared, bringing chaos to Jikandia and setting the wheels of time turning once again. Plunged suddenly into this newly-temporal reality, the people of Jikandia fell into confusion, terror, and anarchy.

In the midst of the mayhem gripping the land, an ancient spirit known as Temtem, hoping to restore peace and harmony to the troubled land, somehow gained mastery over time and space. With this new-found power, Temtem attempted to summon the nine heroes of legend. Nine kids on their way to school found themselves summoned through time and space to become the champions of Jikandia. However, only Hall, who was separated from his friends while traveling through the void, appeared before Temtem. Neither of them knew what had happened to Hall's friends, but it soon become clear that Hall had to find them, and right Jikandia's wrongs, if he was ever to return home.

In Jikandia, you must travel through dungeons in search of your friends. You can set the time limit for each dungeon yourself! Dungeons are altered in several ways according to the time limit you set, so no adventure is the same twice! The longer you spend in one, the more likely you'll come across rare items and treasure chests...but you'll also face more monsters and difficult traps. Also, by meeting certain requirements, you can unlock specific events and cause legendary items to appear. Activating the "Focus" mode will make you stronger, faster, and more powerful! Obtain magic orbs to customize your hero skills as you wish. Up to four PSP systems can be linked to play in the Jikandia Coliseum timed stages where you can battle against your friends and dodge traps to win with the highest score!</Overview>

    <Overview>Military robots cause havoc in a high tech Metropolis research facility. In Finland, genetically-engineered creatures take over the top secret Deep Space Communications Array. A team of super powered criminals, having never worked together before, seize a Nevada missile base. And deep beneath the surface of Mars, dozens of alien warriors are released from their long imprisonment…

These seemingly unrelated events prove to be pieces of a sinister plan, and it will take Earth’s greatest superheroes to stop it: The Justice League!

Justice League Heroes is an action game, also for two players cooperatively, based on the popular DC Comics series. Control DC’s most popular heroes: Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Green Lantern, Martian Manhunter, The Flash, Zatanna and a handful of unlockable characters like Aquaman, Green Arrow, Hawkgirl, Huntress, Hal Jordan, and Kyle Rayner. In addition, the PSP version features exclusive unlockable heroes: Supergirl and Black Canary.

Players battle through famous locations such as Metropolis, S.T.A.R. labs, and for the first time, the Justice League's Watchtower.

Many of DC’s greatest villains face against our heroes including Braniac, Killer Frost, Darkseid, and Doomsday. Boss battles are furious and unique, with no two defeated the same way.

Superpowers are developed through experience orbs collected from a wide range of enemies such as The White Martians, Brainiac’s assassin droids, and alternate-dimensional creatures. Some special orbs known as “boosts” can enhance superpowers. The boosts range from enhanced damage, efficiency, attack range, luck, speed, and super power duration. Multiple boosts can combine into a single, more powerful boost. Players can allocate their orbs and boosts to customize heroes to best suit their playing style.

Special shield icons placed throughout the game can be collected and spent to unlock characters and alternate costumes which affect the heroes' abilities as well their appearances.</Overview>

    <Overview>"It all started when we broke that shrine."

Sugano Fuu is a 1st year student who goes to Tsukiyado High School.

One day she along with her upperclassman Norizuki and her classmate Hirose decided to investigate the "Seven Mysteries of Tsukiyado" as part of their club activities.

It wasn't a particularly interesting topic to find information on, they were just wasting time.
"Ah, There's a weird shrine at our school isn't there. Why don't we go investigate?"
In that kind of noncommittal fashion they went to look into it.

At the shrine Hamura and Kuga were waiting.
They weren't really on good terms with those two, they were more like complete strangers.
With a quick greeting the investigation started.

The shrine was pretty old and even though it wasn't locked the door wouldn't open.
It seemed like it was rusted shut, when they tried to pry the doors open they quickly crumbled.
Within that dirty rubble they saw "something".
As they blankly gazed at that "something" suddenly smoke started pouring out.

"What if it's poison gas!!"

With all their might they threw the "something" as far away as they could.
But after all that they were still enveloped in the smoke coming from that "something". And before they knew it they were transformed into frogs.</Overview>

    <Overview>Tsukasa, a fiercely independent youth who lost his parents at an early age and now spends his days working at a Chinese restaurant to make ends meet.

Reluctant to form interpersonal ties lest they be shattered, Tsukasa is nonetheless unable to abandon the illegal immigrant girl he finds collapsed in the alley behind his workplace one day. Confronted by her utter helplessness he takes her in, an encounter that opens the door to a new life - one where he faces the challenge and wonder of being no longer alone.

Tsukasa soon finds himself at the unwilling nexus of even more lives, attracting a band of misfits and social outcasts around him that swell beyond the confines of his small apartment. They find shelter in an abandoned house, where despite Tsukasa's lingering doubts a pact is formed: the "family project", an alliance of mutual convenience and utilitarian support that despite the mistrust and antagonism among its members soon comes to mean much more.</Overview>

    <Overview>With the surprising apparition of the labyrinths, the whole world was changed. Many adventurers delved into these mazes, hunting for riches, and it wasn't long till the children started following their dreams of becoming heroes. To aid these children, the Adventurer Academies were founded, to prepare them in their perilous journeys.

Players start out at the Particus Academy, the newest of the academies, where they'll be able to assemble their party from students, each hailing from one of the 10 available races, 15 professions and 3 alignments. Each race has a different attitude toward the others, keeping the party compatibility system already featured in the previous games. The academy serves as a home base, where students can modify their team, purchase/sell equipment, practice alchemy, heal/revive injured party-members and take on new quests.

The labyrinths have an overall similar layout, but a few sections are randomly generated upon entrance, so are the enemy and item locations. Battles are turn-based, with a tension gauge slowly filling, allowing the party to unleash Gambits upon their foes. If the whole party is defeated in one of the labyrinths, as a last resort, a rescue team can be sent after them. The longer the rescue team takes to find them, the higher the chance that certain items will be lost, or even party members could die permanently.</Overview>

    <Overview>King of Clubs is an innovative action-puzzle game, combining the challenge of the traditional ball-rolling puzzler with the classic tacky seaside pastime of mini-golf. As an evolution of the ball-rolling puzzle genre, each level has multiple solutions, and as further equipment is unlocked, new paths through each hole become viable. Building on the great tradition of sorry-looking mini-golf courses, the game is set in a dilapidated theme-park which takes decaying kitsch to new extremes.</Overview>

    <Overview>This game is based on the Kingdom manga and anime series. It's a beat'em up game that has a lot similarity to Dynasty Warrior franchise in terms of controls, attack combos, field items and winning conditions. The only thing that makes this game unique is the 5 man squad combat system, where the character can do combos with the other 4 members of the squad. When your character has gained enough power (from attacking, taking damage, or just charging it up by holding one of the two attack buttons) you can unleash the special attack that varies on the type of squad you are using. You are not the only player that can do this though, as some enemies can use special attacks.</Overview>

    <Name>King's Field: Additional I</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2006-07-20T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The country of Verdite has descended into decay. Its royal family began practicing dark magic, guided by evil forces lurking beneath the surface of the country. A remote descendant of the cursed bloodline, Zoela Reinhardt, married the captain of the king's guards, Houser Forester. This valiant man went off to fight horrifying creatures that appeared within the Royal Cemetery. He has not returned, and neither did anyone who accompanied him. His son, John Alfred, ventured into the depths of the cemetery, determined to find out what has happened and whether there was still a chance to rescue his father.

The original King's Field is the first of the first-person fantasy RPG King's Field series and is notable for being one of the first fully polygonal 3D games. It was released in Japan weeks after the launch of the PlayStation, and never localized or released elsewhere. When King's Field II was later released in the West, it was renamed King's Field for those regions. The journey takes John Alfred Forester through a five-level dungeon populated by a few friendly NPCs and deadly traps and monsters. The entire world, including objects, enemies, and the player's own equipment, is rendered with 3D textured polygons.

The player collects gold and items from slain enemies, and can purchase weapons and spells at two shops located within the dungeon. Weapons and magic are assigned to different buttons so the player can easily attack with both, however, recharging action bars for each prevent rapidly spamming attacks. Skills and stats increase with use, and items can be bought or collected that raise specific stats when used (green Verdite stones raise magic, for example). The final boss can only be defeated with magic, encouraging players to grind a well-rounded character to a maximum level.

Each level of the dungeon holds enemies more difficult than the last, as well as greater rewards. The game takes place entirely within the narrow walls of the dungeon, with the only "safe" areas on the first floor. Players can save their progress to the memory card by activating crosses mounted on walls throughout the levels.</Overview>

    <Overview>A storm runs through the kingdom of Verdite, taking away the precious Moonlight Sword and spreading evil throughout the land. Players take on the role of Lyle, the king's son, in his quest to retrieve the Moonlight Sword and save the kingdom and his father. Unfortunately, the king fell victim to the ensuing corruption, and Lyle must acquire magical powers from the four greatest mages in the kingdom in order to complete his quest.

King's Field II is a first-person action role-playing game. Despite the number in its Western release title, it is the third game in the series, originally entitled King's Field III. The events of the game take place fifteen years after those depicted in its predecessor. Gameplay-wise, it is similar to the previous installments, offering vast interconnected areas open for exploration and a variety of enemies to defeat with the help of weapons and magic. The game's world is larger than in the earlier games and has more open-air areas, including several towns with friendly NPCs. Magic is divided into disciplines and special crystals are required to become proficient in any of them.</Overview>

    <Name>Knights in the Nightmare</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2010-11-09T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>A great war once raged across the land with many a valiant knight falling on the field of battle. In the end, the evil forces have prevailed, and have since taken over and corrupted the once great kingdom. On a stormy night a Wisp is awakened by a strange armored maiden. The wisp holds the memories of the war, and is now seeking all the valiant dead to be brought back to the world of the living in order to complete their mission and take back the land that was once theirs.

Knights in the Nightmare can be considered a tactical role-playing game, though it features a number of gameplay elements unusual for the genre. The game is almost entirely stylus-controlled on Nintendo DS, and combines an active-time turn-based combat, somewhat reminiscent of Final Fantasy as well as real-time strategy games, with bullet-hell shoot 'em up-like sequences, relying on a set of unorthodox requirements for the successful completion of its battles.

Once in the field of battle the player controls the Wisp who can cause the spirits of fallen heroes inhabiting the area to temporarily reconstitute into their physical form and do battle with monsters that now roam the land. The player can recruit those warriors permanently into their party by seeking out objects that meant something to them while they were alive.

The game features a robust character customization system that includes many classes of units, multiple jobs per each unit class, and a soul transplant system that allows the player to transfer part of the attributes of a character into another, more or less well depending on the poured soul's degree of loyalty, as well as the existence of a relationship between the two characters and the nature of it.</Overview>

    <Overview>Legends of War: Patton's Campaign is a Spanish-made turn-based tactics game. 

As the title suggests, the game follows historical battles of General Patton and his 3rd Army in World War II, leading you from France to Berlin. The game consists of two parts: managing your troops between battles by spending money or experience to acquire new troops, level up veteran troops or increase your "Patton's skills" to gain combat bonuses and the missions itself, the completion of which gives you a certain amount of points depending on how well you did.

There are several mission types: Attack, Infiltration, Defense, Sabotage and Escort. The troops you have span from simple infantry soldiers to Rangers, snipers and even tanks and aircrafts. Each unit has a certain, separate amount of points for movement and attack. Also, each unit has two kinds of attacks and some troops like the commandos also have a context-sensitive attack (e.g. knife stealth-kill).</Overview>

    <Name>LEGO Batman: The Videogame</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2008-09-23T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Continuing the tradition of adapting known franchises such as Star Wars and Indiana Jones with visuals based on LEGO, this game takes on the Batman universe. The basic concept is the same, with characters and objects built up using LEGO blocks, but here shown against surroundings drawn in a regular fashion. Most of the environments are side-scrolling with a fixed camera perspective, but in 3D with quite some depth.

It is not based on a certain movie or comic, but on the franchise as a whole with a new story. The animations and sequences are rather quirky and share nothing with the darker atmosphere of the contemporary Batman movies. A cast of villains has escaped from Arkham Asylum and now roam through Gotham City wreaking havoc. The first half of the game, players control Batman and his sidekick Robin to take on all enemies with typical brawler gameplay. Enemies will often respawn endlessly until the player figures out how to progress. The environments can be explored using a number of gadgets such as the batarang and the grappling hook, and players can switch between the two characters at any time. They can both fight and the inactive character is always controlled by the computer AI. Both characters have unique powers they can access by changing their suits. Batman can then glide through the air or plant bombs, while Robin has for instance a technology suit that allows his to walk on metal surfaces in any direction. They can also drive certain vehicles.

Both characters operate out of the Batcave that acts as a central hub to store trophies and access missions. Many of the missions have small puzzle elements with buttons or passages that need to be cleared. Objects and characters explode into smaller LEGO blocks and at certain sections the hero need to build structures with blocks to create new objects. After completing a mission in the story mode, it becomes available in a separate free play mode.

In the second part of the game players take control of the different villains such as Poison Ivy, The Joker, Mr Freeze, The Riddler, Killer Moth, Hush, Clayface, Man-Bat and more. They all have different powers and their section of the game always ends at the moment they are confronted by Batman and Robin. This way, the game shows how they set up their plans prior to the fights in the first part of the game. The characters collect coins, objects and hearts. Even though they can die, they immediately respawn.

Multi player options vary between platforms. Home console and Windows versions allow drop in/drop out co-op. The PSP release fares worst of all and does not contain any kind of multiplayer option.</Overview>

    <Name>LEGO Indiana Jones 2: The Adventure Continues</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-11-17T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>LEGO Indiana Jones 2 for handheld platforms is similar in gameplay to the game on consoles, but has simpler graphics and completely different levels. Unlike the console game, the handheld version focuses on the fourth Indiana Jones movie, with elements from the earlier films only appearing in mini-game format and some unlockable bonuses.

The story of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull is retold in three acts of four chapters each, with comic-book-style cutscenes between levels. The levels themselves follow the usual LEGO game format: players control several characters and can switch between them at will. Different characters have different abilities which must be used in combination to overcome challenges and solve puzzles. For instance, Indy can use his whip, Marion and other female characters can cross special ledges and Indy's son Mutt can use his knife to cut ropes and can also climb walls. A major part of the game is the collecting of LEGO studs, red and gold bricks and other hidden items, which unlock various bonuses like additional characters. Finding pages of Indy's journal unlocks one of 16 mini-games.

The mini-games are inspired by certain scenes from all four movies, including the rolling boulder run from Raiders of the Lost Ark, the mine cart chase from Temple of Doom and the three trials from Last Crusade. The games usually task the player to survive for a certain time or to collect a certain number of studs before dying or reaching the end of the level.</Overview>

    <Name>LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-05-10T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>LEGO Pirates of the Caribbean: The Video Game for handheld platforms is similar to the console game, but features simpler graphics, fewer and smaller levels with their own level and puzzle design, and a unique dueling mechanic.

As in the console game, the handheld version allows players to play through events of the four Pirates of the Caribbean films, with the game released as a tie-in with On Stranger Tides. Cutscenes from the console version are partly reused, partly newly done to fit in with the different design. The handheld version features only four levels per movie compared to the console's five.

Actual gameplay follows the standard template of earlier LEGO games: players move through the levels playing as several characters with different abilities, whose skills must be combined in order to defeat enemies and solve puzzles. Collecting LEGO studs, bricks and other items like medallions and rum bottles allows the unlocking of bonuses. A unique feature of the handheld version are pirate duels: when prompted, players have to press a button rapidly, which is then followed by a quick-time event, for which two out of three of the indicated buttons must be hit for a successful strike against the enemy.</Overview>

    <Name>Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2006-09-12T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The Legos strike back in the sequel to the original LEGO Star Wars: The Video Game, where players now get to explore the original trilogy (Episodes IV, V, and VI) of the Star Wars movie series. Players use LEGO-ized Star Wars characters to reenact all three of the original movies. All of the sets and props are also made out of LEGO bricks, and retain their properties such as the ability to be rebuilt and fall apart. Like its predecessor, the game puts a spin on the series by adding a light-hearted, humorous touch to the movies, and also by using no dialogue.

LEGO Star Wars II is a third-person action game with platforming elements. Players take control of the characters and vehicles of Star Wars. In Story Mode, players reenact the key events of the original movies with LEGO bricks. Each character has different weapons, like lightsabers for Jedi or crossbows for Wookies, as well as new character-specific attacks and maneuvers. Each character also has different abilities, e.g. Jedi being able to use the force, R2-D2 being able to unlock doors, or Boba Fett being able to use his jetpack. It is up to the player to use these abilities to solve simple puzzles and traverse the levels of the game. Vehicle levels are more prominently featured than in the previous game, with longer sequences dedicated to piloting traditional Star Wars aircrafts.

In addition to a single-player game, there is also a co-op mode that allows two players to go through the Story Mode. In the single-player mode, the second character is controlled by the AI. Like in the first game, the Free-play mode allows players to go back and replay beaten levels with any playable character they have unlocked. A new feature allows players to create their own mixed-up LEGO characters and vehicles. Power Brock items and coin stubs collected in Story Mode will also unlock new characters, vehicles, and items for players to experiment with.</Overview>

    <Name>LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-03-22T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The handheld editions of LEGO Star Wars III: The Clone Wars (the LEGO version of the 2008 CGI-animated TV series of the same name) play similarly to their home console cousins, while still retaining the family-friendly content in the process.

The games offer 13 levels (based around the first and second seasons of the TV series), which mostly consist of the platform puzzle-solving layout as previous LEGO video game efforts (whilst defeating a multitude of droids along the way as well as other familiar foes). Most levels also take place in flight-mode, where players need to carry out several missions e.g. defeating an army of vulture droids. Each level is split into 3 acts (which are then available to play separately as part of Free Play mode).

Unlike previous LEGO Star Wars games, Jedi characters now have the ability to climb walls with their lightsabers, trace shapes and even use the Jedi Force jump to reach further heights. While characters like Obi-Wan Kenobi, Anakin Skywalker and Ahsoka Tano make up the main character lineup for Story mode, additional characters can later be unlocked to unveil hidden minikit pieces and Red Bricks in Free Play.

These versions also contain several minigames including Snowball Fight (where you need to defeat several characters from the Clone Wars universe with snowballs) and Droid Volleyball (playing a volleyball game with R2-D2 and R3-S6), which require a Red Brick to unlock them.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2006-05-23T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Controlling an army of lemmings, the aim is to get as many of these cute characters as you can from the entrance point to the exit point of a level within a time limit. Easy to learn, difficult to master; Lemmings is a test of strategy and fast thinking as you make 'on the spot', life or death decisions for your band of trusting little creatures. Use the unique skills of your Lemmings team to overcome the hazards ahead: The 'Bomber' explodes at will, the 'Floater' can survive high falls and the 'Basher' digs horizontally just when you need it. The 'Climber' is at hand for those tricky mountain ranges, the 'Blocker' creates an obstacle in the path ahead and the 'Builder' is there to construct walkways for his friends. Stretch your strategies across 100 plus levels as you lead your lemmings across an immense variety of challenging backdrops. The levels are arranged into five striking themes, each with its own unique visual flavour. So, whether it's going underground into the sewers or marching through fields and forests, the lemmings always have new terrain to explore.</Overview>

My fathers job is finally coming to a stable place.
My life of constant movement is over, from now on my father, me, and my little brother will live together.

Winter, It's December close to Christmas.
A memorial service for the tearing down of the old Tenhou High school building is held. Even though it's a different kind of event from a usual culture festival the lively students plan many kinds of attractions.

Me and my classmate Kushige and the Morals Committee Chairman Sawato also start preparations.
On that normal day, I suddenly get informed that my father has been in an accident and is now in the hospital.

He was in a traffic accident and is forced to stay in the hospital for a few days. The doctors say that only sustaining that level of injuries is almost miraculous.

    <Name>Little Britain: The Video Game</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2007-09-21T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>This is a collection of mini-games based on the UK comedy sketch TV series Little Britain that ran between 2003 and 2006. The included games are based on some of the scenes and recurring characters. It also includes the original voices of the two leads and the narrator. Players need to unlock the different games by competing in a Tour with three difficulty levels. On Easy, for each 50,000 points another game is opened up and clips from the series are unlocked. The included games are set at different, fictitious locations in Britain and require a lot of button mashing:
Darkley Noone: Vicky Pollars needs to complete two laps on roller-skates in a skate park. She has to collect CDs to throw a party, while avoiding hazard, performing tricks when jumping in the air, and grinding on rails.

Herby: Lou and Andy go to the swimming pool, but as soon as they are there, Andy doesn't like it. While Lou explains to a guard how he wants his handicapped friend get to swim, Andy need to dive off diving boards and perform tricks. There are three boards to choose from and he needs to get back in his wheelchair before time runs out.

Sessex: Weight Watcher guide Marjorie runs around in a supermarket collecting cookies in a Pac-Man-style mini-game. The ghosts are represented by fatties she needs to avoid, but by picking up cake (similar to the original power pellets), she can take them out for a short time.

Slut: Letty has to squash all the frogs in her living room, making sure not to hit any other objects. Gameplay is similar to the Whac-A-Mole concept, except that the frogs jump around instead of popping up.

Old Haven: Emily, a real lady, needs to score a number of goals in a game of football (soccer) before time runs out. She needs to progress over the pitch step by step and avoid hitting the defenders as that returns her to the starting location. She does get points for shooting them in their private parts. The PSP version is slightly different as it is presented as a game of penalty kicks, without defenders. The direction and the force of the kick can be determined separately.

Pox: make matches of three identical items collecting food in Maggie's gullet as she gulps it down. Once it is full, she can spew out all the food over her friends at the party for extra points.

Llandewi Breffi: Dafydd Thomas is the only gay in the village and needs to prove it. He rides a bicycle through the streets and needs to collect copies of Gay Magazine while running down other people and slapping fake gays.
The PSP version contains an additional game:
Flatley: help "Eh Eh Eh" Anne at the psychiatric institute to destroy the flowers in the garden. She can stamp them, pull them out, and then smash it or chuck it. She needs to avoid the men in white coats that chase after her. She can temporarily stun them by flashing them when she lifts her skirt.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2009-11-17T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Travel to the world of LittleBigPlanet, where dreams and imagination run wild! Become a Sackperson, and dress them up as you wish with all sorts of gear that you come across in the game worlds. Explore the levels made by the Creator Curators, or create your own and send them to the world!

LittleBigPlanet is a platform game based on the PlayStation 3 game of the same name. In it, you control a Sackperson, with the base goal of reaching the level exit. However, many physics-based objects and puzzles are encountered along the way. There are also many tricks, traps and enemies. Aside from being able to jump, your Sackperson can also hop between the two levels of depth (unlike the PlayStation 3 version, which features three levels) in the level to walk in front or behind objects, grab objects to push or pull them, or even hitch a ride on a tethered jetpack and fly about the area.

A huge feature of LittleBigPlanet is the ability to create and share levels with millions of other players around the world. You can make your own levels with objects you've collected in the single player mode, and then use those objects to make anything you like - whether it be a platform level, action game, music box - anything! The level creator allows for a lot of freedom and also offers detailed tutorials on how to use and place objects, as well as tweak their variables. The PSP version of LittleBigPlanet is not able to play four player simultaneous multiplayer like the PS3 version - instead it is a single player only game.</Overview>

    <Name>Littlewitch Parfait: Kuroneko Mahouten Monogatari</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2012-03-22T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Parfait Sucreal is a young witch, who is yet in training and full of clumsiness in raising a potion shop called Black Cat Market run by her mother and Parfait's black cat, Sakemas, who can amazingly talk. A year ago from the time this game was set, her mother had died from an illness - her father was a famous wizard who died from saving the kingdom when Parfait was young.

At the beginning, Parfait introduces herself and tells the player that she is almost at the risk of losing her beloved shop (the only remains of her mother), for Parfait has to pay the debt of 1,000,000G (gold) by 12 months to keep the shop running. As a normal shop, there seems no hope for raising the Black Cat Market's fame.

The player's motive is to collect this debt by 12 months in various ways such as putting cauldron-made potions to the shop counters for customers, accepting potion orders at the end of the day and sell her potions on the street. As Parfait gains more experience via studying in the library or creating potions, her levels will rise (with a maximum of six stars) which enables her to succeed more on potions that are high-leveled. Many places may trigger the encounter with other important characters whose futures the player must decide by motivating Parfait.</Overview>

    <Overview>The blob-like LocoRoco are in trouble! A meteor has crash-landed on their planet, bringing with it the black, shaggy Moja Troop, who just happen to find that LocoRoco taste delicious. Soon, they're nearly all gone! It's up to you to take control of the planet using your PSP and repopulate it so that it's full of LocoRoco once more.

LocoRoco is a unique game for the PSP that is very simple to pick up and play. The L and R Buttons tilt the game world to the left and right, causing the LocoRoco to roll in that direction, while pressing both L and R simultaneously makes the world bounce and causes the LocoRoco to jump.

LocoRoco love to eat, and their favourite fruit is the red berries that are native to the planet. For each one of these that you eat, the LocoRoco grows bigger. It may in fact become too big to squeeze through smaller gaps, however this is not a problem. If you tap the Circle button, the LocoRoco will shriek and break up into smaller ones. If you hold the Circle button, they will all call out and assimilate back into the singular LocoRoco.

There are also little blue men called 'Mui Mui'. These folk are tucked away in the more hidden parts of the levels. Discover them, and they'll reward you with additional parts to build your own 'Loco House', as well as give you different music tracks to play in it. Your Loco House can be customised to your liking, and then you can watch as a LocoRoco explores it, and possibly earns you even more house parts. You can also share your Loco House with a friend.</Overview>

    <Overview>Midnight Carnival is a spin off of the LocoRoco games, and forms a sequel to LocoRoco 2 and was released as a halloween special.

LocoRoco BuiBui, a red, sinister version of MuiMui, pulls on a nearby star which opens a trapdoor over a chute and into a cannon which sends LocoRoco into the titular Midnight Carnival that was designed by BuiBui as a secret base, and also gives LocoRoco the new "boing" power. It is now up to you to get out.

Gameplay is unchanged from previous LocoRoco games, you still have to roll along by tilting and bouncing your way over walls and climbing up walls. Each stage of the game tracks both your score and time progress. You can now dress up your LocoRoco.

Multiplayer comes in the form of four player ad-hoc games, which can be played over any of the single player levels.</Overview>

    <Name>Lord of Apocalypse</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-12-17T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Lord of Apocalypse is a Monster Hunter-like game and is the sequel to Lord of Arcana. The plot is similar to it's predecessor: A human who can wield the power of the Arcana must retrieve the seven fragments of the Arcana Stone and become the Vermillion Lord. Along this quest, the hero will have to face and stop a dark entity who is swallowing worlds.

The game also plays a lot like Lord of Arcana. There are however several differences: new elements are available, there are more customization options for the hero creation, the enemies can be fought head-on, without having to touch them to engage in battle, and dropped items don't need to picked-up manually; simply moving close to them sends the items in the inventory. The Quick Time events from the previous game are still there, but they are not necessary to defeat the bosses. They are rather an opportunity to collect rarer materials by destroying some monster parts. The visual style is also less realistic, some cut-scenes are even cell-shaded. Mercenaries, one of which can be set to resurrect the hero when needed, can now be hired to aid the hero in his quest.

Like in other hunting games, the various weapons allow a variety of combo attacks, but magic can be cast in the middle of a combo. Weapons and armors are crafted with the various materials gathered from the different enemies and bosses. Different quests are available to power up the hero and gather resources.</Overview>

    <Name>Lord of Arcana</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-01-25T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Lord of Arcana is an action game in which the player (as a customizable character) is taken to the world of Horodyn, where he will have to acquire the Arcana power. To do so, he will need to hone his skills by completing quests from the village of Porto Carillo's slayers guild. The quests consist of defeating specific foes, gathering material, and so on. As the player becomes stronger, the Arcana Stones from the nearby Arayd Temple will awaken, allowing the Master Guardians to be challenged, and their power claimed.

The quests happen in set locations such as forests, caves and deserts. Upon defeating monsters in these quests, various materials can be obtained (either from the field, after battles or by destroying Monster Parts) and be used to craft equipment in the village. Apart from usable items like potions and charms, a variety of weapons, armors, orbs and cards can be equipped.

Weapons: five types of weapons exist, each with their specific strengths ans weaknesses. Changing weapon will be useful depending on which opponent the player wants to face.

Armors: The armors, shield and headgear. They can bestow great protection and sometimes have slots to equip orbs.

Orbs: They have a wide array of powers. Some can be used to boost elemental attacks or defenses, some allow quicker movement or makes the weak points of monsters visible.

Cards: Needed to cast magic. There are regular spells and the more powerful Ultimate Magics, which summons the Arcana Guardians to perform some incredible feats.

The Guild also act as a place where multiple players can join and quest together via the PSP's ad hoc mode. The available quests are the ones that the host player can access in regular gameplay.</Overview>

    <Name>Machi</Name>
    <Overview>"Machi" literally means "district", "city area". The game was called by their creators a sound novel. 

The idea of the game is to let the players experience five days in the lives of eight different characters. They all live somewhere in the city, each one preoccupied with his (or her) own problems. Their paths might cross without them realizing it. At any point in the game, you can switch between characters, but when you do so, the day or the time of the day of the other character corresponds to the one you are currently having. 

The eight protagonists are: Keima Amemiya, a policeman; Jintaro Umabe, an actor; Masami Ushio, a gang member; Yoshiko Hosoi, without a particular profession (the only female protagonist in the game); Masashi Shinoda, a student; Ryuji Takamine, a deserter; Fumiyasu Ichikawa, a writer; and Yohei Tobisawa, a high-school boy. You control the characters by making decisions for them: where to go next, how to answer to another character, etc. In many cases, there are wrong decisions which lead to a premature end (bad ending). The story is presented through text (without voices) and still shots of live actors and locations, with occasional short animated sequences.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2005-09-20T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The Madden series makes its first appearance on the PSP with Madden NFL 06. Based on the concurrent console version, it adapts some of its modes for play on the handheld, removes others, and adds some unique features, including several mini games.

Gameplay modes include exhibition games, wireless head-to-head play (online or ad-hoc), practice, and franchise. Modes and features that have not made it over from the consoles include owner mode, superstar mode, Madden Cards, creating teams, or the ability to challenge plays. The new gameplay features QB vision or hit stick (due to lack of a second analog stick) are not in the PSP version either, but precision passing has made the cut. The game also features connectivity to the PS2 version: it is possible to transfer franchise games from PS2 to PSP and vice versa, allowing one to play one set of games at home and another on the road, with results available on both systems.

The Mini Camp mode from the console version has been expanded and features ten exclusive mini-games, playable either on their own or in a competition. Another PSP-exclusive feature is an assistant coach mode.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2006-08-22T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>With the exclusive video game license of the NFL and its players, and currently in its 17th installment, Madden NFL 07 puts you in control the running game like never before. For the first time ever, step up as the lead blocker to create a hole, and then take control of the tailback and smash through, overpower, or slash away from would-be tacklers as you fight for every yard. Innovative rushing controls give you a game-breaking ground attack featuring all-new jukes, cutbacks, and the distinct running styles of your favorite backs.

The game adds some of the new control options introduced in the console versions, including the Hit Stick (toggled on the PSP via the triangle button) and Lead Blocker Control. The main game modes are unchanged from the previous year and include "play now" quick games, wi-fi multiplayer, mini-camp and franchise (still without Owner Mode or Storyline Central, but with the exclusive Assistant Coach mode). The PS2 connectivity option now allows to transfer entire franchise seasons between PSP and PS2. A new addition is the mini game "End 2 End". In this mode, the PSP is held vertically. A runner moves towards the end zone and faces a number of tacklers. Upon noticing the direction the tackler is going in, the player must respond by hitting the correct direction button in time to evade. Score is given for quick reaction and multiple evasions in a row. Reaching high scores in this mode unlocks music tracks and hidden teams.</Overview>

It presents players with a number of real situations from games from the 2006 NFL season, asking them to replicate star players' moves like making last-minute touchdowns or long passes.

The new "weapon" system from the consoles has made it to this version, allowing players to quickly scan for mismatches at the line. Returning features are ad-hoc and online multiplayer and connectivity to the PS2 version, allowing franchises to transfer between the platforms.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2008-08-12T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Madden NFL 09 for PSP is another yearly update in the series. Regarding modes and options, it is very similar to its predecessor. Besides the usual roster updates, it introduces several features designed to make the game easier for beginners.

All game modes of the previous year return: play now, franchise, mini-camp, practice and Superstar Challenge. The challenges have been updated and now feature situations from the 2007 season. The game introduces a Rookie Mode, which simplifies controls, reducing them to a few buttons, and also introduces prompts indicating what to press when. Also considering new players, the playcalling system has been redesigned and features basic and advanced options. Another new feature is a new defensive camera, which in a break from most football games has the camera behind the defensive line, with the offense moving toward the screen.</Overview>

    <Name>Madden NFL 10</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-08-14T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>After three PSP iterations of the franchise developed at EA Canada, development duties for Madden NFL 10 returned to series main developer EA Tiburon. The game features all the modes of the previous version, and also adds several new features.

Returning game modes include play now, franchise, mini-camp and practice. Superstar Challenge mode also returns (with all-new situations from the 2008 season), but offers an additional twist: in addition to playing the "Hero", players can also play the "Spoiler" and prevent the historical moments from happening. A play designer has been added that allows players to create plays and formations for use in the game's playbooks. Created plays can be uploaded to the PS3 version.

On the field, a mini-game for fumble recovery has been added, similar to the one seen in other versions: when during a fumble, both teams are in range of the ball, who gains possession is decided by a quick-time event, requiring both mashing of buttons and hitting the correct buttons in sequence. Another addition is a player momentum system: depending on their performance during a game, individual players have hot or cold streaks, influencing their further performance. The game also features newly-recorded commentary by Tom Hammond and Cris Collinsworth.</Overview>

    <Overview>After the final Book of Darkness crisis, Nanoha Takamachi and Fate Testarossa refuse to send Reinforce away to ensure that the Book's regeneration program won't harm anyone again. However, this means that the remains of the Book of Darkness (闇の書の残滓 Yami no Sho no zansai) soon return and Nanoha and her friends are forced to fight them. These remnants take form of twisted, dark copies of real people called "dark fragments" (闇の欠片 yami no kakera). In addition to Nanoha, Fate, and Hayate's own dark copies, they soon have to face the three much more powerful and dangerous clones of themselves known as "Material", as well. Every playable character must face and defeat the clones of their own friends to advance their storylines. 

All of the playable characters except the Materials have their own different story route in the game. Every route has the same basic structure: the player must first pass a training session, then defeat the dark clones of two of their best friends, defeat one Material boss, defeat the clones of two more freinds, then lastly defeat a Material boss version of themselves.</Overview>

    <Overview>Major League Baseball 2K9 is a simulation of the sport of baseball. The heart of the game is the franchise mode where the player can play whole seasons with its hundreds of matches and a managerial part. Besides keeping the balance, there are three main activities in this part: studying extensive statistics, player trading and hiring players through free agents. The latter is similar to other sports games: every player has other wishes for his team, e.g. athletic success. If the player's club can fulfill these wishes better the club has to pay less salary. Trading however is handled differently: Every club gives a value to the players on the roster. This value influences how the trading plays out. Training is another important part to consider.

Matches can either be simulated or played manually. Every part of the match has its own control scheme: For pitching the player uses two parts of his input device: the first for aiming and the second to recreate a movement (depending on the used move). Batting is done by swinging the bat in the right timing. He can also influence the ball's direction in the way he hits it. During fielding the player basically tells the controlled player the direction in which he should throw the ball. Besides the franchise mode the player can participate in training, Home Run Derby and Postseason mode (play-offs). Players can unlock training cards.

The are a few small differences between the versions: on the Wii the player controls batting and pitching directly with the remote and the nunchuck and the PSP version features slightly different fielding controls. In the franchise mode the player can manage up to four franchises in the PS2 version and there is a farming system on PSP.</Overview>

    <Overview>The fourth entry of the Atelier Iris series, this time around the player takes control of a student named Vayne Aurelius at the Al Revis Academy for Alchemy, where players complete tasks and quests set before them by a professor of the university. If a player fails to complete these tasks they will have to stay behind and also the story will change depending on who the player chooses to work with during these quests.

The game still features RPG-style elements, but now with different features. Instead of "leveling up" by defeating enemies where the player can choose how there character will develop using a "crafting" system, letting them choose which attributes they want to modify. Players can also "craft" items and weapons using various objects scattered throughout the world.

Players will no longer have random engagements, something more common in many RPGs, this time around the player can choose who or what they want to fight with the ability to see your opponents symbols on the board, choosing if they want to engage them.

The PSP version features multiplayer battles, more items that can be synthesized, and an option to reduce loading times.</Overview>

    <Overview>arriage Royale's story revolves around the male protagonist, a high school student named Hinomoto Tsukasa, who is told one day by his parents that he was adopted. Furthermore, they tell him that his real father is a manager of a large company, meaning he is very rich and holds a lot of power. Tsukasa's real father wants his son to marry a good woman, so he sets up an event known as Marriage Royale where beautiful girls from all over Japan will come together at a school built especially for the event and vie to become Tsukasa's fiancé. The school is located on an isolated island near Japan, and Tsukasa himself is taken there to live in a mansion in the care of two twin maids: Miku, the elder sister, and Miu, the younger sister.

There are various paths the player can take in the game beyond the main marriage path provided that the player fulfills the correct requirements to open those paths up. These paths are designated by different colors and include a red route which involves investigating dangerous ruins and a yellow route which involves the girls aiming to be idols.</Overview>

    <Name>Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2005-10-04T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Marvel Nemesis, the game that has Marvel Comics' greatest superheroes face off against Electronic Arts' newly created Imperfects, comes to the PSP as a pure fighting game without the story mode of the console version, but instead with its own modes, array of characters and a unique card collecting element.

The main mode in the game is the Campaign. Two different campaigns are available: one for Marvel heroes, one for the Imperfects. Each consists of ten fights that have to be won in order. At the start of the game, only two characters can be selected: The Thing and Johnny Ohm. Completing a campaign unlocks another character, whose campaign completion unlocks another and so forth. Fighting through the campaign also unlocks further arenas. All in all, there are seven arenas, ten Marvel characters and eight Imperfects. Compared to the console version, the roster loses Daredevil and the Human Torch, but gains Dr. Doom and Captain America.

Fights are best-of-three bouts and are mainly controlled via analog stick for movement and the PSP's four buttons, used for attacks, jumps, grabs/throws and locking on to the enemy/blocking. Characters with the appropriate superpower ability can use flight or teleportation via the left shoulder button while the right shoulder button is a context-sensitive superpower enhancer, enabling extra-powerful attacks and blocks, the details of which vary by character. Superpowers require the power meter to be charged. Both power and health recharge automatically. Landing a series of hits on the enemy increases the Rage Meter, that when full enables unlimited use of superpowers for a short while. The arenas include a lot of destructible terrain and objects for picking up and throwing.

After a campaign fight is won, the player is first awarded a medal (gold, silver or bronze, depending on the length of the fight) and can then pick a collectible card from an assortment of five, all face down. Like in a collectible card game, these come in common, uncommon and rare varieties. It is more likely to get rarer cards with the better medals. They come in four basic categories: health, defense, power and strength. The cards can give bonuses during a fight, like increasing health or attack strength, faster recharge times, increased rage length, etc. There are also character-specific cards that can be used only with the character in question. In the game's card book, the cards can be grouped into decks, one of which can then be selected before a fight. In-game the cards are activated through the D-Pad. Only two card slots are available from the start, the other two have to be unlocked in the campaign. Combining certain sets of cards (like all character-specific cards) awards further bonuses. All in all, the game includes 173 cards (the count includes unlocked characters and arenas). Unwanted or duplicate cards can be traded in for other random cards with the recycling option, taking into account their rarity value.

The game includes a Quickplay and an ad-hoc multiplayer mode which allows the use of unlocked characters, arenas and collected cards.</Overview>

    <Name>Marvel Trading Card Game</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2007-02-27T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Marvel Trading Card Game is a strict electronic conversion of the Vs. System collectible card game rules by Upper Deck. It includes cards from all of the Marvel-based Vs. sets through the X-Men set.

The gameplay involves head-to-head battles where players recruit superhero characters with various strengths and powers onto the playfield. Each character has a basic Attack and Defense value which determines the outcome of individual character battles. This basic mechanic is augmented by character powers, Equipment cards (which give the character additional powers/stats), Location cards (which affect multiple cards or game rules while they are face up), and Plot Twist cards (which are often played to change the outcome of individual character battles by boosting Attack or Defense values).

The game features two single player campaigns, tutorials, puzzles, and an online mode similar to Magic The Gathering Online. The online mode supports cross-platform play between the PC and PSP versions.</Overview>

    <Overview>Dr. Doom has united supervillains as the Masters of Evil. Now for the first time ever, over 20 Marvel superheroes including Spider-Man, Captain America, Wolverine, Ghost Rider, Blade and Silver Surfer have come together to stop Doom. Mix and match your choice of Marvel superheroes, in teams of four as you travel across the Marvel Universe to stop this threat. Certain teams such as The Fantastic Four and The New Avengers provide additional bonuses.

Some heroes must be unlocked first. The game also features RPG elements, such as leveling up. When a hero gains a level, they earn points you can use to upgrade their skills. You also collect Shield Coins, which can be spent on boosts for your hero team.

You explore various legendary Marvel locales, from Asgard, to Prince Namor's Atlantis, where you take on foes with punches, kicks and super powers. Super powers drain energy, however, so use them wisely. Combos can be achieved by combining super powers. Energy is restored by collecting blue orbs from fallen foes.

Boss battles are like the comics themselves: titanic battles that often not only test brawn but your brain as well. With over 20 playable heroes plus all the cameos, there are over 100 heroes and villains.

The game modes feature either single player, co-op, or online play. In general, Marvel Ultimate Alliance's gameplay can be considered an improved version of 2004's X-Men: Legends. The different versions are fairly identical. The PSP release has three more game modes, while Wii, PS3 and Xbox 360 have additional levels.</Overview>

    <Name>Marvel: Ultimate Alliance 2</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-09-22T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 continues the four-player mayhem of the previous Marvel Ultimate Alliance and, before that, the X-Men Legends series. It is based on the Secret War and Civil War storylines from the comics. After Nick Fury leads an unauthorized super-hero assault on Latveria and a fight gone wrong kills hundreds of civilians in Connecticut, the government passes the super-human registration act, which requires all super-powered individuals to reveal their identities to the government. At one point in the story, you have to choose the pro or anti registration side and certain heroes will always be on one side or another, locking them out if you choose the other path. The game after this point changes depending on the storyline you choose.

You start with a handful of characters and can unlock more by completing bonus simulator missions, which will give you a special task like blowing up cars. There are four heroes active at all times during the game, unless they get knocked out. Each character has a health meter and a stamina meter. You can use SHIELD access points, usually at the beginning and middle of each level, to switch out characters. The stamina meter recharges on its own and controls use of powers. Each hero has a jump (which can also be used to double-jump, fly or web-swing, depending on the character), grab, quick strike and powerful strike. These can be used in combination to do things like jumping attacks, pick up an enemy, then punch them, etc. Combining these with a modifier button allows you to use powers. Each hero has a wide variety of powers. Leveling up gives you points to spend on improving the powers. You can re-assign the points and change which powers are active at any time.

Defeating enemies and smashing environment items gives you health refills and points that can be spent upgrading statistics for each hero. There are also items that you can carry that will give stat bonuses like increased HP or a bonus to a specific type of damage.

The big change over the previous game is the addition of fusions, which are two-character team-up attacks. This is controlled by a meter of four stars. You fill this by defeating enemies or finding an item that instantly fills the whole meter. You can spend one star to revive a fallen teammate or all four to perform a fusion attack. Any possible combination of two characters has their own unique fusion. There are three basic types:

There are targeted fusions, like having Things throw Mr. Fantastic at someone. These do high damage to a single target and are good for using on bosses. There are also clearing fusions, like having Storm bounce her lighting off Wolverine. These damage all enemies in a given radius. Clearing fusions are good for clearing out a clump of enemies. Finally, there are guided fusions, like Iceman and Human Torch shooting their powers at each other, then running around mowing down anyone who gets between them. These are good for clearing out scattered enemies.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2007-11-13T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>In the sequel to the PSP-exclusive Medal of Honor: Heroes, players take the role of OSS Operative John Berg during the Normandy campaign of June 1944 in eight missions. He needs to get behind enemy lines and prevent Hitler from deploying the V2 rocket, with the help of US troopers. The story is told through briefings with still voices and narrated voice-overs.

Next to the classic first-person shooting gameplay true to the series, the Wii version offers a new, more accessible mode with on-rails shooting - the computer handles the movement while players only need to aim and shoot. In the regular mode, players move around with the analog stick, look around with the Wii remote, lean with the Nunchuk and fire with the B-button, a departure from the control system introduced in Medal of Honor: Vanguard. The game also offers a lock-on system with the Z-button. Alternately, players can use the Wii Zapper to aim and shoot.

The regular combat remains, but much more events have been added with a few mini-games thrown in. For instance, players need to twist the Wii remote to tune a radio for mid-game incoming information and the sound comes through the remote's speaker. Other quirks require the player to raise the Nunchuk to pump the shotgun. Players need to plant charges (twist the Wii remote like a timer), pick up documents and man various stationary guns. This version also marks the return of the sniper rifle and adds bazookas and mortars.

Up to 32 players can simultaneously join a single match, with game modes such as Death Match, Team Death Match and Infiltration. Multiplayer maps are adaptations of the single-player levels.</Overview>

    <Name>Megamind: The Blue Defender</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2010-11-02T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Megamind: The Blue Defender, is a 3D character action game with additional elements of exploration, puzzle solving and ability collecting/swapping. The game is based on the film Megamind. The player assumes the role of Megamind – the super villain determined on exacting revenge on Metroman.

Just as Megamind has become our new Mega Hero, a sudden crime wave hits the city. The Doom Syndicate &amp; their Doom Goons have emerged and are looking to take over! They have broken into Megamind's Lair and Hal has transformed himself into "Blue" Titan. Unfortunately, due to a mishap Hal has taken both Megamind's &amp; Metroman's essence. It is up to Megamind to once again clear the city of crime finding clues to make his way to Titan.

With help from an arsenal of weapons, they player gets to destroy, shoot and punch his or her way through a city populated by goons and members of the Doom Syndicate. The player can use various abilities against enemies. Aside from shooting Megamind must also collect abilities, explore and solve puzzles to reach the end of each level. Action is a large part of the game: the player spends the majority of his or her time fighting ex-creation robots and other enemies. At regular intervals in the game, the player also encounters bosses which require a different approach. Each boss has its own theme, and requires more than running and gunning to defeat them.

Megamind's abilities are gained through finding and unlocking new weapons scattered throughout the levels. Each weapon is also able to trigger special objects found in the levels to open up new paths and collectibles. Finding all collectibles and unlocks in the game requires the player to go through each level multiple times.</Overview>

    <Overview>The year is 2016. An airplane is hijacked by unknown terrorists. On the board of the plane is senator Hach, an important US politician, who might be the next president of the country. In exchange for the senator, the terrorist want something from the US government. You don't know what that something is, but it goes under the code name "Pythagoras". Since handing it over to the terrorist is not what the government is planning to do, it sends you, the famous special agent Solid Snake, to rescue the senator and to find out who is really behind the hijacking.

"Metal Gear Acid" is set in the familiar Metal Gear universe and graphically resembles the PS2 titles of the series, but its gameplay is quite different from that of the other games. "Metal Gear Acid" combines the traditional stealth gameplay with strategy. It is a turn-based game in which you plan your turns by selecting playing cards that are available in your card deck. Each card represents an action: attacking, moving, etc. You must plan your actions carefully to stay unnoticed and also plan ahead which cards you'd want to keep during the next round, and which you are ready to sacrifice in order to make an efficient move immediately.</Overview>

    <Name>Metal Gear Ac!d 2</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2006-03-21T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>What happened after the first Metal Gear Ac!d is somewhat left for open discussion as Snake is suffering from some serious amnesia right from the game start. He doesn't know much about his past, but is well aware of his skills, as are his newly acquired companions. Returning back to the US from a mission well done, his only hope is that he'll start remembering his past as he steps on a friendly soil. But instead of having some time to do so, an FBI agent takes him and his friends into custody, leaving him with only one option to save his friends, and that is to help the agent with a mission of his own. Reluctant but left with little to ponder about, Snake agrees until he can connect some dots.

Unlike the prior game, the game uses a 3D cell-shading technique making the game less realistic but more colorful, now spanning over 500 cards at your disposal. Gameplay is basically the same turn-based style as the original, though comes with certain enhancements like being able to undo your moves to a certain degree, or moving in real-time and not losing moves on opening doors or crouching. There is also a new type of cards that is self-triggered when you use other cards, usually enhancing your action in one way or another.

The Metal Gear Ac!d 2 package comes with a Solid Eye, a special type of 3D glasses (a cardboard box that slides over the PSP, not the blue-purple plastic but with lenses) to play the game with a 3D effect. You can also use it to watch various Snake Eater and other movies as you unlock them in the game, giving you the feeling of 3D space.</Overview>

Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker's story will explain the events which lead to Militaires Sans Frontières becoming Outer Heaven in later games and also see him finally accepting his role as Big Boss. Snake is still struggling with the guilt over the murder of a person who was very close to him.

One day, Snake is introduced to Ramón Gálvez, a peace teacher, and his student, Paz Ortega. The two want to ask for Militaires Sans Frontières hand in helping the country of Costa Rica. Recently, an unknown armed force with high-tech weapons has been creating trouble around the country and because Costa Rica's constitution forbids a military army there's nothing anybody can do about it. Snake at first refuses to help, believing that it may cause more tension in Latin America, which many believe is the centerpiece of maintaining power in the East and West. But after being presented a tape recorder by Gálvez which accidentally recorded a conversation between two women, Snake agrees, believing that one of the voices on the tape belongs to The Boss herself. Snake then sets out on a journey, a journey to not only bring peace back to the land of Costa Rica, but also bring peace upon himself.

Peace Walker is set between the events of Snake Eater and the original Metal Gear. Snake is controlled via the analog stick and the rest of the buttons vary depending on the type of button configuration you choose; shooter type, action type, or hunter type. Gameplay consists of that usually seen in the Metal Gear series, which is stealth-base movement. That doesn't mean you always have to be stealthy though, if you want you can just let go and shoot up your enemies with different weapons ranging from the M16A1 to a Stun Rod. Cutscenes are presented in an artistic comic book style similar to that of Portable Ops, with some being interactive.

Near the start of the game you will be given a central mother base to use for a number of different things. It is here where you can save your game, develop weapons, and embark on quests. At the Mission Selector screen you can replay previous missions to gain a higher score and also participate in extra ones not necessary to the main story. Cutscenes in which you have watched throughout the main campaign can be seen once again. Developing and upgrading weapons is done by spending currency known as GMP in which you obtain doing quests. At Mother Base you will be able to assign your MSF staff into different teams depending on their abilities and skills. Putting the right people in the right place will open up more opportunities to develop more items and weapons.

Multiplayer in the game is limited to ad-hoc mode and co-op. All story missions can be played with up to two people and the other co-op missions with four people. After completing certain missions and meeting certain requirements, Snake will be able to head to an island where you and some friends can engage in hunts against monsters from Capcom's Monster Hunter series.</Overview>

    <Name>Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2006-12-05T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops is the first real Metal Gear game on the PSP, unlike the two preceding Metal Gear Ac!d games with turn-based strategy gameplay.

It's been six years since the events in Snake Eater. Snake has been captured and imprisoned in an abandoned missile silo in Colombia, and with no support this time. At least, not at first. With the help of a fellow prisoner, Snake escapes and the game truly begins.

Portable Ops is a classic Metal Gear game in almost every sense. The controls will be familiar to anyone who has played previous console entries in the series. Snake can peek around corners, sneak up behind guards... they even carried over CQC (Close Quarters Combat) from Snake Eater.

What really sets Portable Ops apart (aside from being on the PSP) is the pacing, and a few changes to the gameplay mechanics. The game is played out in missions, which are specific to certain areas. Most of the areas are not that large, which sometimes means seeing "Mission Complete" in only a matter of minutes. The ability to play through the game in segments really lends itself to the handheld format. If you only have five minutes, choose a quick mission, knock it out, save and you are done. Being able to return to each area whenever you want to procure more supplies means that even once you finish your mission, you will be coming back.

Gathering supplies is also essential due to the main new mechanic found in Portable Ops: recruiting. While Snake starts out on his own, he can enlist disgruntled guards, frustrated technicians, stubborn doctors and more. These soldiers can be used in your "Sneaking Unit" (the team you take into battle for each mission), or in one of the many support units, with certain soldiers having a more natural talent for certain areas. If you put someone who has medical bonuses in your Medical unit, they can produce rations, help your troops recover faster between missions and more. Technicians can create new items for your team, and Spies can steal ammo and give you intel on specific maps, which can open up new side missions or allow you to grab some heavy weaponry.

Missions themselves range from recon to rescue to demolitions and beyond. You can only take four troops into a mission, and usually one of them has to be Snake. However, you don't have to always use Snake during the mission, he just has to be present. You can only control one character at a time, while the rest of the team hides safely inside boxes (usually right by the entry point). On the field, the soldier you use can make a big difference. Many times you can totally bypass a building's defenses just by playing as a guard. If you do not do anything to draw attention to yourself, you can oftentimes walk right past the enemy, plant some TNT, and walk away.

Several soldiers even have special abilities that come in handy during a mission, such as being able to transfer extra items you pick up directly to your truck (each character is limited to four inventory slots), or drag unconscious enemies twice as fast.

The game supports multiplayer for up to six player simultaneously, over WiFi Ad Hoc and Infrastructure, with game modes such as Team Death Match, Death Match and Capture Mission.</Overview>

    <Name>Miami Vice</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2006-07-18T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Miami Vice is a third-person shooter for the PlayStation Portable. It was released as a tie-in with the movie of the same name. Therefore, the likeness of the narcotics officers Crockett and Tubbs are based on that of Colin Farrell and Jamie Foxx, respectively.

While going through levels, the majority of the gameplay is combat, with enemies who must be killed to advance the level. Emphasis is put on taking cover, with health running out quite fast if player remains in the open during a shoot-out. All fire-arms have laser sightings, which acts as an aiming reticule.

The player may also deal drugs amongst other suppliers, both buying and selling. Drugs can be bought at one point and kept for several days, in which they may increase in value, thus making a profit for the player. Additionally, varying drugs can be obtained throughout each of the levels, and sold for a profit once the level is complete. Drugs can also be sold to informants for information.</Overview>

The challenges include; trick missions (learn new tricks), stadium and circuit races (full-length and small-segment races respectively), points missions (do the most tricks for the most points), and time trials. Each mission can be done on either Easy, Medium, or Hard difficulty. The level of difficulty determines how much experience the player gains, and each level-up provides more parts for customization, and more levels to play in.</Overview>

    <Overview>A book written by a potentially paranoid man named Atrus serves as a portal to an otherworldly place, the island of Myst, in this atmospheric adventure game by developer Cyan. Forgoing the character interaction and inventory-based puzzles found in earlier computer adventure games, Myst places you in a lonely, desolate environment with no obvious indication on where you should go or what you are supposed to do. By exploring the island, you will eventually stumble upon an assortment of puzzles in the form of intricate contraptions, whose secrets can only be unlocked after discovering evidence of their nature. As you progress in the game, you will find four other books written by Atrus that magically transport you to additional worlds, each offering more interconnected puzzles and clues to the storyline. Myst's look is noteworthy for featuring still images viewed from a first-person perspective, with interaction limited to manipulating a cursor over each static picture.</Overview>

    <Name>Naruto Shippuden: Kizuna Drive</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-03-22T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The gameplay retains many of the elements from the previous game. One of the new features is the ability to fight alongside three other allies during levels. Players can assign various scrolls to characters for increase of health, chakra and attack power. In addition, they can equip various ninja tools and techniques for the characters to use. The techniques include long-lasting effects, such as Lee's Eight Gates and Karin's Mind's Eye of the Kagura. The feature to have three allies with you allows the performance of "team attacks", which include the four standing in a square formation and knocking the enemy around and finishing with each performing one of their techniques, resulting in an explosion. 

The player can call any of the three allied characters to perform a technique on their enemy, resulting in the gaining of Kizuna Points. The higher the amount of Kizuna Points when the mission is finished, the higher the rank you receive on it. Kizuna Points can also be used to revive fallen allies and, if the player falls, an ally will immediately go to revive them if there is enough Kizuna Points. Kizuna Points can also be gained by performing team attacks. 

The game features many challenges. The main challenges are battles with false tailed beasts. The three that appear are the One-Tail, the Two-Tails and the Nine-Tails. Though they are considerably smaller than the real thing, they posses the same abilities and some unnamed, game-only attacks. Perhaps the greatest challenge is fighting the Three-Headed Guardian Beast, a huge, lion-like monster with power equivalent to that of a real tailed beast. 

The graphics of the game have been greatly improved since the previous games.</Overview>

    <Overview>NBA 09: The Inside is the sequel to NBA 08 where once again the player can partake in a new chapter in "The Life" mode. This time around the player can take control of a created superstar (five total) with the ability to interact with three different characters and constantly change the storyline. 

The Team Progression System makes a return, rewarding the player for game exploration and completing certain achievements given to them throughout the game. Completing these tasks can unlock certain accessories that they can use for their created character, showing off their status. Players can also associate with various teammates and coaches, how they act towards these characters will determine their place with the team (being a team player and helping out others will have the coaches play you more and have create a bigger fan base and being a individual loner will alienate them from the team and have a smaller fan base).

The obligatory game modes also exist in this version as well (Franchise, Exhibition) as well as updated NBA rosters with every NBA team available. The Havok engine is introduced for this version, giving the game a more realistic feel when combined with new animations and enhanced character models.

NBA Replay also returns, letting players relive classic moments from the 07/08 as well as partake in the 08/09 season by downloading them off of the Playstation Network (five each week during the season). Players can also upload and share data, show off their created superstars and track their progress through leaderboards and even play against each other in online exhibition games.

Audio commentary is provided by Seattle Supersonics star Kevin Calabro and franchise newcomer Kenny "The Jet" Smith.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2006-06-19T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Race events take place only at night and players cannot access freeroam. Tuning is a major factor in gameplay; to unlock more, both performance and visual parts, players need to collect 'upgrade points'.

Players can either play both Underground Mode (Career) and Quick Race. The Underground Mode can be played in four difficulties. Statistics are viewable in the Driver Status screen in My Underground.

Circuit Race - This mode is divided in four class: Master, Novice, Pro, and Car Spec. The first three are merely race events with horsepower restrictions, while Car Spec allows only compulsory cars to take part in particular events.

Drag Race - In a long straight, players accelerate their car up to max speed. This mode is only playable with manual transmission.

Drift Attack - Players have to drift on several markers, that are placed on the ground. Winner is the one, that collected most drift points.

Lap Knockout Race - Any player that completes a lap in last place will be eliminated. This goes on until one is left.

Nitrous Run - To win the race, players need to get from one checkpoint (called gate) to another. By passing through a gate, time and nitrous will be added.

Street Cross - Racers will drive in a narrow indoor circuits containing 90° and 180° curves mostly. Street
Cross is greatly based on Street X.

Rally Relay - Players drive two laps around a circuit. After completing the first lap, the player has to swap her/his vehicle.

Players don't get any benefits for customising their car visually as there's no Star Rating. Visual parts don't come separate, but in bodykit sets only. However, players can now write their own lettering and put them on the windscreen, backlight and bonnet.

Most important are performance mods, with which players can modify acceleration, top speed and handling. Any car in this game can be upgraded to be very competitive to even the strongest production cars. After purchasing a performance part, players can install it in other vehicles without re-purchasing.</Overview>

    <Overview>What Did I Do To Deserve This, My Lord? is a real-time strategy game for the PlayStation Portable.[2] The game centers on creating mazes and monsters to help defend a demon lord from heroes seeking to capture him.

Using a limited number of "steps" and a pickaxe, the player must dig and create a maze with monsters in it to defend the demon lord from heroes. More steps are given when a stage is cleared, based on how well the player did. The "steps" have another function, however, they are also used to add levels to monsters.

At first, the player must dig and create the maze while creating monsters before a hero comes to capture the demon lord. When the hero appears and is going to enter the maze, the player must take the demon lord and change his location, preferably making him harder for the hero to find. When the hero gets into the maze, he will take random paths (if there are more than one) until he finds and captures the demon lord. The hero will fight against any monster that gets in his way.

When the hero captures the demon lord, he will retrace the same path, taking the demon lord with him. It is possible to create monsters to save the demon lord during this.</Overview>

    <Overview>"A Real Treat for Fans"

One Piece: Romance Dawn

Preface: This is still a Japanese-only title. I know Japanese, so this presented no obstacle to me in playing the game, but for the purposes of this review, I will assume that you also know Japanese or are using a translation patch to make the game's text legible to you. Wandering in the dark, language-wise, will obviously produce a very different gaming experience that I would estimate would warrant knocking at least three points off the score, unless you enjoy such strange challenges.

Romance Dawn, taking its title from the first chapter of the ongoing, decades long manga, One Piece, is the first full-blown turn-based RPG to cover a sizable portion of the series' actual storyline (and not a non-canon story, as with real-time RPGs Unlimited Adventure and Unlimited Cruise). The gameplay elements alone make for a rather shallow RPG, but the One Piece coat of paint does its job well, and assuming you're a fan of the series, it is that aspect that makes playing Romance Dawn worthwhile.</Overview>

    <Name>Onore no Shinzuru Michi wo Yuke</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-06-11T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Published in 2009 by From Software, having been developed by Silicon Studio, Onore no Shinzuru Michi wo Yuke is in fact a massively updated PSP version of a Flash game called Cursor*10, developed in 2008 by Yoshio Ishii. For convenience we'll refer to the update as Shadow Ninja, which isn't really a translation of the Japanese title, but would probably make a decent localized name, if any North American or European publisher had decided to publish this outside of Japan (they haven't). The title actually translates to something like "Go the hell the way you believe in!", or something like that - it's a rather impolite and direct command. With Shadow Ninja being steeped in Japanese culture, containing heavy emphasis on Ukiyo-e artwork and similarly appropriate music, its release in the West never happened. Even so it is an ingenious concept backed by some beautiful aesthetics and, despite some fairly major flaws later on, is still worth looking at alongside its Flash originator.

The concept of Onore (and its Flash precursor) is simple: you are given 10 ninjas (lives) and need to traverse 16 floors, each connected by stairs and filled with various objects to increase points, traps to steal lives, plus switches, keys and other hotspots used to activate the next set of stairs. Think of each floor as an individual puzzle, which sometimes interacts with another floor through use of switches or a key which needs shlepping to a lock three floors up. Each ninja though only has roughly 60 seconds to do his thing, before that "session" ends and you take control of a fresh ninja. As the sessions increase up until the final 10th, all the previously used ninjas will continuously replay their lives - and here lies the puzzle element, since some ninjas' sole purpose will be to stand on a switch thereby allowing those that follow to access whatever's now unlocked. Others will need to disable traps by impaling themselves on spikes, kamikaze style. In this way it joins the small genre of temporal-themed puzzle games, alongside Echoshift and TimeSlip.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2007-07-17T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>PaRappa the Rapper (パラッパラッパー Parappa Rappā?) is a rhythm video game for the original PlayStation created by Masaya Matsuura (the former leader of the Japanese "Hyper Pop Unit" PSY S) and his NanaOn-Sha company. The game is remembered for its unique graphic design, its quirky soundtrack and its bizarre plot. Despite being made in Japan, all of the game's songs and dialogue are spoken in English in all versions, but has subtitles in languages such as Japanese and German. The game is named after its protagonist, Parappa, a rapping dog with the motto, "I gotta believe!".

The game spawned a merchandising campaign in Japan, a spinoff in 1999, a TV series in 2001, and a direct sequel for PlayStation 2 in the same year. A PlayStation Portable port of the original game was released in Japan and Korea in December 2006 and in North America and Europe in July 2007.</Overview>

In addition to the orange pegs there are also blue pegs that are the majority and give less points, purple pegs that are worth 50x the value of the blue and green pegs that activate a magic power. In total there are 10 magic powers, each tied to a character that can be chosen before a level. On the bottom of the screen is a bucket that moves left and right. Hitting the bucket results in an extra ball. For each level, the player has 10 balls to use.</Overview>

    <Name>Persona 2: Eternal Punishment</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2012-05-17T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Persona 2: Eternal Punishment (????2 ? Perusona Tsu: Batsu?) is a role-playing video game developed by Atlus, and chronologically the third installment in the Persona series, a subseries of the Megami Tensei franchise. It was originally published in 2000 by Atlus in Japan and North America for the PlayStation. The game was later remade by Atlus for the PlayStation Portable. This version, released in Japan in 2012, did not receive an overseas release. In response to this, the PlayStation version was released on PlayStation Network in 2013.

Eternal Punishment takes place in the fictional Japanese city of Sumaru, and is a direct sequel to Persona 2: Innocent Sin. Taking place a few months after Innocent Sin, the game follows reporter Maya Amamo as she investigates the Joker Curse, a malign phenomenon where people's wishes and rumors are coming true and causing chaos. During her investigations, she and others who join her gain the ability to summon Personas, personified aspects of their personalities. The gameplay features turn-based battle gameplay, where characters use their Personas in battle against demons, and a separate Rumor system, where rumors spread around the city can influence events in the characters' favor.

Halfway through the production of Innocent Sin, writer Tadashi Satomi felt that a fresh point of view was needed in addition to Tatsuya, laying the groundwork for Eternal Punishment. The original producer (Kouji Okada), character designer (Kazuma Kaneko) and composers (Toshiko Tasaki, Kenichi Tsuchiya and Masaki Kurokawa) returned alongside Satomi. The second game began development after Innocent Sin was completed, and while it reused most of the assets from Innocent Sin, the gameplay and Rumor system were improved upon. The game's theme song, "Change Your Way", was written by English singer-songwriter Elisha La'Verne based on the game's premise. Reception of the game in Japan and the west has generally been positive, with reviewers appreciating improvements over Innocent Sin, the plot, the gameplay systems, and the improved localization compared to the original Persona.</Overview>

    <Overview>Working very closely with Peter Jackson and Wingnut Films, Ubisoft's Montpellier studio (Beyond Good &amp; Evil) and its Montreal studio (Splinter Cell) have created a game reflecting the visual interpretation, character dynamics and dramatic narrative of Jackson's epic take on the classic King Kong story.

    <Name>Phantom Brave: The Hermuda Triangle</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-03-08T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Phantom Brave is a strategy RPG which takes place in the world of Ivoire. Ivoire consists of vast seas and numerous islands; it used to be a peaceful place, but an ancient (and powerful) force is now threatening life in the various lands. The character you control in the game is Marona, a 13 year old orphaned girl. Marona has the ability to communicate with phantoms, an ability that brings a lot of resentment from other people but will help her to head out into the world and solve the problems that are occurring. A phantom known as Ash acts as Marona's guardian; as the game progresses, other phantoms will join your party, each of which have different capabilities.

The game features a turn based combat system. During battles, Marona is able to attack enemies by herself, and she can also summon phantoms in her party to help out. To summon phantoms, you will need to confine them to an object on the screen (such as a rock or tree). Once confined to an object, you will then be able to control the phantom in battle, though phantoms only remain controllable for a limited number of turns. The object you confine a phantom to will affect it's abilities; for example, a rock may make a phantom stronger but move slower. By defeating enemies in battle you earn experience points allowing to level up and become more powerful.</Overview>

    <Name>Pilot Academy</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2006-10-27T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Pilot Academy is a flight simulator on the PSP which encompasses all eras of flight, ranging from historic WWI fighter planes such as the famous Fokker Triplane (flown by the "Red Baron" Manfred von Richthofen) to modern military and civilian jet aircraft like the F-15, F-16 and Boeing 747. All aircraft names and designs are licensed.

In the initial lessons, the game teaches the player the basics of powered flight for both civilian and military purposes. The game uses all PSP buttons to deliver a flight simulation feel with the analog nub serving as a joystick. Controlling the flaps, air brakes, raising and lowering the landing gear as well as using the tail rudder are also possible. Military aircraft feature air-to-ground missiles, air-to-air-missiles, a machine gun and flares for self defense against missiles. The only thing missing from the simulation is a fuel gauge, but since most missions are rather short, this was probably a deliberate design choice. 

After civilian and military flight lessons are completed, the player is free to choose from various missions and challenges. Completing a task successfully unlocks new aircraft in the player's hangar which can then be flown any time in free flight mode (but only on the tropical map). Distinctions are also awarded for completion of a mission based on time taken, aircraft integrity, completion of objectives and level of excitement/comfort of passengers (if any) and determine the level of proficiency of the player pilot.

Flights take place over different types of terrain including tropical, desert, snow covered mountains and canyons and in varying weather conditions like rain, snow and even in a storm. Some missions begin while already airborne, while others require the player to taxi onto the runway, takeoff and land after completing the objective. 

Multiplayer supports up to four players dogfighting against each other or cooperatively with planes from any of the four military eras, e.g. a dogfight between a WWII propeller plane like the P-51 Mustang or the Spitfire versus an F-14 Tomcat or F-16 Falcon is possible.</Overview>

Players must battle their way through the events of "Dead Man's Chest" and "At World's End" using a variety of sword and item attacks, in addition to a system called "Black Pearls", which only allows players to block for so long until the Black Pearls are drained and no longer able to block until it recharges. Each character has their own special attack, and other weapons, such as pistols and daggers, can be found for use in combat.

The console and PC versions uses regular controls, whereas the Wii version makes use of the Wiimote for motion based attacks. The game makes use of quick time events called "Jackanisms", which allow players to handle themselves through certain events in a manner that Captain Jack Sparrow would.</Overview>

    <Name>Piyotama</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2007-08-09T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Piyotama is a puzzle game where the goal is to manipulate colored eggs and line up four or more in a row to "hatch" them. The eggs can only be manipulated when outside of the "nest" (the play area), which is accomplished by sliding the selected row of eggs to the left or right using the dpad. The order of the three eggs pushed out of the nest can be cycled left or right using the X and O buttons, respectively. The current row can be changed with the up and down directions on the dpad allowing them to be re-inserted on a different row to form lines of matching eggs.

Once a line of four eggs is formed a "hatch" is begun, giving the player a short time to create more lines of eggs to form a combo to score more points before the eggs hatch. When the "hatch" timer is up any eggs that formed part of a line will hatch and the little Piyos will fly off to collect on either side of the screen. An egg will hatch even if it is no longer part of a line of matching eggs, so long as it is not being held outside of the nest. The remaining eggs will fall to fill in the gaps. When enough points are scored the player's level increases.

An additional dimension is added to the controls by the use of the Sixaxis controller's motion-sensing abilities. By shaking the Sixaxis from side-to-side the eggs can be shaken to fall into gaps. Shaking the controller up-and-down will cause the eggs to jump about offering limited control in re-ordering the eggs beyond manipulating them three-at-a-time beyond the nest. If a hatch has started, shaking the controller will cause the eggs to hatch immediately. The maneuver can be particularly useful in the battle mode when the eggs are getting close to filling the nest, which would result in the end of the game.</Overview>

    <Overview>The big city of Collosatropolis has reached the limits of its expansion. The Collostropolan leaders have decided to solve the problem by invading the neighboring country of Mungola. Since Mungolans are simple, earthy types they don’t expect much of a struggle. Mungola’s defense force consists only of a single squadron of fighter planes – the F-27 Platypus.

Platypus is a side-scrolling shooter, where you use your little space craft to blast the enemy ships. Shooting some formations gives the player weapon upgrades for twenty seconds. All models in the game were designed in clay, photographed and then digitally coloured. There are 20 levels in four different worlds each with their own themes and enemies.

The PSP version includes minor changes. It adds worlds, ships, and enemies not in the original game, constructed from existing graphics, with new movement patterns. The weapon balancing and bonus scoring system have been changed. Enhancements include a save system, a new Survival mode and Wi-Fi multiplayer action for 2 players.</Overview>

    <Overview>An evil magician crashes a teenagers' party, uses his powers to load all their cars on his trailer and transform them into miniature cars themselves. The friends Hannah, Claire, Vicky, Roger and Mitch need to free themselves by racing pocket cars on tracks, where winning races is awarded with soul gems and soul shards that can return them to their human form.

Races are grouped together in different soul challenges with identical gameplay but different settings such as a garden or a bathroom. Since the cars are very small, the roads are loaded with huge items such as bottles and everyday appliances. The tracks have short-cuts, jumps and slopes, as well power-ups that destroy the environment, provide rockets or freeze the opponent's car. There are four camera perspectives (all third-person) and a button to reset the car when straying away from the track.

Next to the soul races there are time trial and practice modes. The car park has many vehicle models with different statistics, liveries and decals. Most of these still need to be unlocked at the start of the game. Aside from single-player games, there are online play modes with game modes as race, soccer, and domination.</Overview>

    <Overview>pop'n music 2 is one of the many titles in Konami's long-running rhythm game franchise. Notes scroll toward the bottom of the screen along nine tracks, and the player must tap the correct buttons in time with the music to play along. Play well, and the "groove meter" increases, but play poorly and it will drop. If the groove meter is high enough at the end of the song, the player can move on to the next song.

This release includes all of the tracks from the first game, along with the new tracks from the arcade release for a total of over 40 songs to play. Several new high-difficulty modes for advanced players have been added, and there is also support for a miniaturized 5-button version of the game called Dokodemo pop'n music that can be played on the PocketStation or Dreamcast VMU. It also functions as a Key Disc for latter Append Disc releases in the series, much like Konami's other Bemani franchises.</Overview>

    <Name>PQ2: Practical Intelligence Quotient 2</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2007-06-18T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>PQ2: Practical Intelligence Quotient 2 (also known as PQ2; Intelligent License 2 in Japan) is a puzzle game for the PlayStation Portable, and a sequel to PQ: Practical Intelligence Quotient. The game is based on testing the model of human intelligence developed by Dr. Masuo Koyasu at Kyoto University.

PQ2: Practical Intelligence Quotient 2 shares many features with the first PQ game and similar platform-like puzzle games. In each stage, the player controls a human avatar in a virtual reality world, climbing and dropping from levels, lifting, dropping, pushing and pulling boxes in order to activate switches and lifts, block laser beams, and to create stairways in order to reach an exit point. The player must also avoid guards that make rounds on the level.

The main game is presented as an intelligence test of 100 stages. The player is given a total cumulative time of 5 hours to complete all 100 puzzles; time is only counted while the player is performing the puzzles, and the player can save and come back at any time without time penalty. The player's score is based on the number of "moves" (excluding walking around) on the stage, the time it took to complete it, and the number of attempts at that stage. A player can skip a stage with a scoring penalty; levels not completed in the 5 hour limit are also penalized against the player. Once completed, the player can upload their score to worldwide scoring tables to compare their results.

Obstacles in levels include:

Boxes. Small opaque boxes can be picked up and dropped, and their height is the maximum height that the avatar can climb up on, thus these are commonly used to make stairs. Larger boxes can be pushed or pulled.
Glass boxes. These boxes operate like regular boxes, but will shatter if dropped from any height or hit by something dropped on them. They also are translucent and will allow both laser and regular light through.
Laser boxes. Like regular boxes but have laser beams that come out of one end. Crossing the beams will prematurely end the level.
Switch panels and switch boxes. Colored switches, when active, will activate platforms that may move across the field or that increase height, while deactivating a switch will cause these platforms to return to their original position. Floor panels are active by stepping on them or placing a box on them, while switch boxes require a laser beam to hit them.
Teleporters. These can be moved like boxes and will teleport the avatar between the end points.
Police officers. These characters roam from one police call box to the next closest one, and shine a line in front of them. Should the avatar be caught in this light, the level must be restarted. The police call boxes can be moved to alter the police officier's behavior.
Detectives. These characters will follow a specific roaming path until they discover footprints left by the avatar. At this point, they will follow the footprints until either the trail is lost, they find an obstacle they cannot pass through, or until they catch the avatar (which then will restart the level). Footprints will disappear after a number of steps, but can also be manipulated by using boxes and other obstacles.
PQ2: Practical Intelligence Quotient 2 introduces the ability to create one's own levels to share with friends, and a "weekly quiz" that can be downloaded through the Internet.</Overview>

    <Overview>You play as the thirteen-year-old princess Gradriel, the daughter of Elfrenne, queen of Valendria. Twenty-five years ago Elfrenne destroyed the demonic forces that were threatening the country. Now the queen has died, and Gradriel is proclaimed to be the future savior of the land, as it was not entirely purged of all evil. And indeed, an evil spirit has secretly invaded Valendria and is trying to take control over Gradriel's two older sisters. Will the young princess succeed in defeating the evil?

The entire game world is a side-scrolling platform on which fights, exploration, and conversation with the NPCs take place. The combat is detailed and contains elements of fighting games. Although the princess develops like a RPG protagonist, she can also use various physical moves in combat: kick, dash, defend, crouch, etc.</Overview>

PlotEdit

The story takes place in a setting similar to Princess Maker 2, a fictitious location that resembles western Europe. The time might be later than Princess Maker 2 as the city looks a little closer to those from the Renaissance than those from the Middle Ages.

    The premise is that before the beginning of the game, magic had just been perfected in the Human Kingdom. Using a kind of magical stone, alchemists and magicians were able to make many inventions in the way of magic. This lead to a revolution of enlightenment in magic, and people were trying to make money by harvesting these stones. However, the main source of this stone comes from the Realms of the Demons deep within a forest, and yet the people went on to mine regardless of the dangers. A torrent of humans poured into the Demon Realm, causing the Demon King to break his silence and retaliated with war. 

    The Human Kingdom was losing terribly, as the human soldiers couldn't stand up against the ranks of the Demon Army. It was then that a hero stepped up and descended into the Demon Realms in order to convince the Demon King to stop by any means possible. Her name was Isabelle, a skilled swordsman and a powerful magician. The war stopped due to her efforts, and the kingdom has been saved. 

    A dear friend of hers who traveled and battled with her was there on the day when she stopped the Demon King's army, but the two separated in that battle and Isabelle disappeared. Desperate to save her, the King ordered an expedition into the Demon Realm to find her, her friend was also in this group. After ten years of searching, the men around him died and the name of Isabelle became a relic of the past. He became the only one who still searched for her without fail, hoping to find her again. 

    One day during his search, the man came upon an Oasis. It was there that he found Isabelle, standing beside a demon youth with a child in his arms. She asked her old friend to take the child and raise her with the humans, and enjoy a normal life as a human. After coming to, he was on the outskirts of the Demon Realm, with a little girl holding his hand. He thus decided to raise the child as his own. Returning to the kingdom, he declined the offer of nobility from the king, and in return asked for a modest little home in which he could raise his daughter. 

The game is heavily dependent on events, the plot aspect of these events will be detailed later.</Overview>

In a show of good faith and an attempt to keep peace and balance in the world, the Human Kingdom decided to crown a princess and eventually a wise Queen who will help pacify each realm. But mysteriously, the candidates for the position of Princess were assassinated one by one. Thus, Cube, a butler and keeper of one of such candidates spirited her away from this world, and erased all memory of her murdered family and torched home so that she might escape the fate of the more unfortunate princesses.

The player is a retired hero from the Human Kingdom, now self-exiled into a foreign world to escape the past. However, when Cube chooses the player as the parent of this girl, the player simply cannot refuse. The conditions are that after eight years, only the girl herself can decide whether she wants to pursue happiness in this world or, if she ever finds out about her past, return to the parallel worlds to claim her throne.</Overview>

    <Overview>Pro Evolution Soccer 2008[1] (officially abbreviated as PES 2008 and known as World Soccer: Winning Eleven 2008 in Korea and Japan, sometimes called World Soccer: Winning Eleven 11 in PS2) is an association football video game in the Pro Evolution Soccer series by Konami. The game was officially announced on 18 June 2007. Its title is different from the other Pro Evolution Soccer games in that it's of a year and not a version; this was due to EA Sports' FIFA series naming their titles with two digit numbers (i.e. 07, 08) and in conclusion would seem that PES was a year behind FIFA (to non-fans which had no knowledge of the previous games of the franchise).

It was released for Windows, Wii, Nintendo DS, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Xbox 360 and mobile phone.

A PS3 demo is available for download from the PlayStation Store,[3] a Xbox 360 demo has been released on the Xbox Live Marketplace,[4] and a PC demo has been released.[5]</Overview>

    <Overview>Puyo Pop Fever, known as Puyo Puyo Fever (ぷよぷよフィーバー Puyopuyo Fībā?) in Japan, is the fifth installment in the popular Puyo Puyo puzzle game series, developed by Sonic Team, released on a wide variety of systems in several regions. Sega published all the Japanese versions of the game; the game was scarcely released internationally, and versions of it were released by other publishers. North America only received the Nintendo GameCube and DS versions, whereas Europe received also received the Xbox, PlayStation 2, Game Boy Advance, and PlayStation Portable versions.

    <Name>Puyo Puyo 7</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-11-26T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>It's a rainy day at a typical Japanese classroom - only that it's raining rainbow-colored jellies! Math wiz Ringo Andou is scared to death of this strange situation, until she is schooled in the ways of Puyo by the familiar face of Arle Nadja. When Arle suffers a mysterious headache and disappears, Ringo sets out on a mission to stop the ongoing flood of Puyo. But the plot thickens as Ringo uncovers plot after diabolical plot and realizes the very existence of mankind is at stake.

Puyo Puyo 7 is different from other Puyo Puyo games in that the story mode is told in 6 acts of varying numbers of episodes, as Ringo Andou (and the friends she meets along the way) travel to place after place, battling popper after Puyo popper to stop a mysterious force from flooding the world with Puyo. There are 19 players in all, with 5 being new (including Ringo). The gameplay, however, is quite similar to Puyo Puyo 15th Anniversary - swamp your opponents in a flood of Nuisance Puyo across 5 (less compared to 15th Anniversary) different game play modes and move on to the next area. 

As usual, there is also the battle mode, where up to 4 players (8 on the DS version) compete to see who is the best Puyo popper. As in 15th Anniversary, only the Original Puyo Puyo, Puyo Puyo 2, and Fever rules are available in 8-player games.</Overview>

    <Overview>A sequel to Puyo Puyo Fever, the next-gen re-imagining of the classic arcade puzzle game Puyo Puyo, in which you play against either an AI or player controlled opponent to see who can stack and arrange the falling blobs (or "puyos") in the correct color patterns that allow you to send "garbage" puyos to the opposing player and help flood him and lose.

The game includes a single-player arcade mode, as well as a story mode with 3 different characters and campaigns that take you across the game world battling different sets of enemies. The "fever" meter from the previous game returns (which increases the number and abilities of the garbage puyos you send depending on how many puyos you chain in succession) and a new ranking system has been implemented that awards you money you can use between stages to buy special items that modify the game rules in your favor.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2011-12-15T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Puyo Puyo!! 20th Anniversary is a puzzle game developed by Sonic Team and published by Sega. The game honored the twentieth year of the Puyo Puyo series, and was first released for the Nintendo DS in July 2011, and later for Wii, Nintendo 3DS, and PlayStation Portable in December 2011.

In total, the game has 20 modes of gameplay, including 8 new modes, and 5 hidden modes from Puyo Puyo! 15th Anniversary.[2] Except in Mission and Pair Puyo modes, a player is eliminated when he/she tops out, and the last player (or side) standing wins the round. 

"Pair Puyo":
A two-on-two team play mode. The teammates share Nuisance Puyo and "lives" - when one of the teams' field tops out, the board is replaced with a new board with a pre-made chain and costs a life. When all lives are lost, the team is eliminated, and the last team standing wins the match. 

You get bonuses for "Extra Chains" (firing a chain during your teammate's chain) and "Synchro Chains" (firing chains of the same length (3 or longer) at the same time). 

Shop:
Like Puyo Puyo Fever 2 there is a shop, but instead of ineffective game play items you can spend points you get from various modes for exchange of Puyo skins, alternate character voices, and alternate character costumes</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2004-12-22T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Puzzle Bobble Pocket (パズルボブル ポケット), is the 2004 PSP Japanese release based on Taito's 1986 tile-matching arcade puzzle video game Bubble Bobble.  Bust-A-Move is the title used for the game series in North America.

Gameplay follows the standard formula: the player controls a catapult at the bottom of the play field that shoots bubbles of random colors. When three or more bubbles of the same color touch, they are removed from the field. After a while, the existing bubbles are pushed down into the play field by a descending ceiling or by more bubbles being added from the top. The game is lost when the bubbles reach the bottom. Special bubbles include explosive ones that destroy bubbles they touch, bowling balls that knock off all bubbles in their path, star bubbles that remove all bubbles of the same color as the bubble they are touched by, and rainbow bubbles that change color into the color of a bubble group that gets popped adjacent to them.

There are four modes to choose from: Single, Endless, VS and Survival. Single is the classic single-player puzzle game, featuring 500 levels. The goal in each is to clear the pre-set pattern of bubbles. Endless is the unwinnable variant in which more bubbles are always pushed in from the top, played for high score. VS is the competitive variant played against a number of CPU opponents, where popping more than the required three bubbles sends them over to the opponent's field. Survival is a variant of the VS game: after winning a round, the own play field is not reset.</Overview>

    <Overview>Puzzle Chronicles is a casual game that combines item-matching puzzling with RPG elements, including character progression and a fantasy story line in the vein of Infinity's earlier titles Puzzle Quest: Challenge of the Warlords and Puzzle Kingdoms.

The puzzle part is played on a board with vertical divider line in the middle. The goal is to push the divider line back to decrease the opponent's territory until no more moves are possible. This is done by matching groups of three gems into like colours along the divider line. These groups fall on the board horizontally. Pushing the divider line back is done by destroying rage gems. There are also special abilities and a sidekick known as a Warbeast that attacks the enemy when a sufficient amount of gems of certain colour has been cleared.

Removing gems also enables the player to collect mana, power spells and items that are then used to attack the opponent and reduce their board space. In addition to the main puzzle game, there are five other mini-games ranging from upgrading the Warbeast companion to crafting new items, while navigating a number of different maps and completing simple quests.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2010-09-22T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The game places the player in the role of Ichihiko. At first glance, he is a fairly ordinary young man who lives an (almost too) ordinary life. He lives at home with his two sisters, Mizubashou and Shirotsumegusa, constantly gets into arguments with his next door neighbor Hinagiku, goes to school with all three and spends the days enjoying life in a virtually perfect world.

There are, of course, some oddities. Firstly, the only humanoids in the world seem to be Ichihiko, his older sisters, Hinagiku and their teacher, Kobatomugi-sensei. Everyone else looks like something resembling old sci-fi movie drone robots that communicate by repeating the phrase "oui monsieur" known as saberhagen-class droids (and are understood the same way Star Wars characters understand the beeps coming from R2-D2). This is a world where it never rains. Where weather conditions are always convenient. Where Ichihiko's favorite shows are always on TV and his favorite foods are always served. Yes, this world is clearly fake.

As the story progresses, the player discovers that Ichihiko is actually the "last mankind" (in other words, the last human left in the universe). He was found in a stasis capsule by the robots that inhabit the spaceship Saint Exupéry-go. Feeling that he is too young to govern over the ship and perform his role in bringing about the second coming of humanity, the robot R-Mizubashou proposes that he be awakened and raised by them, and that a suitable "happy" world be built just for him; a world where he has a loving family, lots of friends and feels no hardships or pain.

Having been without any humans to serve for nearly a millennium, the robots draw upon on almost every possible source to build what is to be Ichihiko's perfect world. To this end, they have used data from "older" robots on board, books, movies and even manga. While the majority of the robots involved willfully continue the ruse (and do everything they can to dispose of dissenters), there are some who wish to tell the "last mankind" the truth.</Overview>

    <Overview>Many centuries after the legendary Holy War that forced humanity to erect a magical barrier to keep both gods and demons from overrunning their world, the Branshaldo Empire and the Aura Republic engaged in an extended war for control of the Grantria Peninsula. The conflict eventually ground to a halt and an uneasy truce was reached, as neither nation had the resources to continue fighting. Even so, the animosity between the two parties never faded, but smoldered beneath the surface, always threatening to explode into flames. In the resulting tenuous peace, the people of the peninsula began to resume their normal lives, always aware that the war could resume at any time.
It was against this backdrop that the protagonist begins their fight against rival factions, hordes of ravening monsters controlled by enigmatic puppet masters, and even their own dark impulses...</Overview>

    <Name>Rainbow Islands Evolution</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2008-01-24T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Rainbow Islands Evolution is a game in the Bubble Bobble series for the PSP system. It is also known as New Rainbow Islands Hurdy Gurdy Daibouken in Japan. It is an enhanced remake of the arcade game Rainbow Islands.

Bub and Bob, the two main characters in the series, are against an evil recording company that seeks to pollute the Rainbow Islands' atmosphere by creating constant musical noise, therefore wilting the flora and mutating the fauna. In this game, Bub and Bob use a hurdy-gurdy (an old European musical instrument) as a weapon to create the rainbows.

The game follows the same vertical-scrolling system from the original, but it expands to a third dimension as there are platforms in the background which become accessible through the course of the game.

The game suffers from reviews stating that it had been overworked with new features, especially those that make this version of the game differ significantly from the original game.</Overview>

    <Name>Ratatouille</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2007-06-26T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Ratatouille is a 3D platform game based on the Pixar animated film of the same name. Unlike versions for other platforms, the PSP game does not follow the plot of the film but instead presents its own story set after the film's climax, with the voice actors from the film reprising their roles for the game.

Shortly before Linguini and Collete can open their new bistro, their recipes are stolen by their disgruntled ex-employer Skinner. It falls to gourmet rat Remy to bring back the recipes so the new restaurant can open in time.

Remy must move through five worlds of six to seven levels each, accessible from the rat colony hub world. The worlds include Linguini's apartment, the sewers, the marketplace, Paris rooftops and the restaurant. In most levels, Remy's goal is to pick up the recipe that lies somewhere in a hard-to-reach place, but other levels consist only of races or boss fights and the recipe is awarded upon winning. To get around, Remy can jump and double-jump, pull himself up ledges, crouch and run on all fours to get into tight spaces, climb up vertical and swing along horizontal poles and also swim and dive. Some enemy critters like spiders, caterpillars and bats want to hinder Remy on his quest, but he can punch them or hit them with his tail to defeat them. Some small puzzles must be solved to overcome some obstacles, usually involving finding a certain object to be used at the correct place. The ghost of chef Gusteau usually offers hints on what to do next, and Remy's fellow rats also sometimes offer helpful advice.

Lying about the levels are various collectibles. Apples and cupcakes restore lost health. Pieces of cheese function as currency and can be traded in with the merchant rat in the rat colony for upgrades: increasing Remy's health bar, adding more combat moves, increasing his swimming speed and more. Hidden in most levels are star keys. These can be used to unlock chests in the rat colony that contain additional recipes not found in the regular levels. Found recipes can be looked at in the game menu and contain actual cooking instructions for various dishes.

The game also includes two multiplayer modes: a race and a cheese collecting game. The race optionally allows placing chili peppers on the track, the eating of which increases speed. The cheese collecting game has several variants. In the regular variant, the player who collects the most cheese within the time limit wins. The 'weighted' variant makes a player slow down upon collecting cheese. Putting the collected cheese into a designated drop area restores regular speed. In the 'chef hat' variant, hats materialize when five pieces of cheese have been collected, with the winner being the player who collects the required number of hats or the most hats after the time limit ends.</Overview>

As she walks around confused a bunch of random guys, who she thinks are transfer students, ask her about the handkerchief but she lies saying she doesn’t have it. When she gets home she runs into Koakuma Bancho who tells her to stop lying and that throwing the handkerchief during a full moon will make something good happen to her.

    <ReleaseDate>2009-06-19T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Rock Band Unplugged is an expansion of the Rock Band series of music video games released for the PlayStation Portable. The game is developed by Backbone Entertainment in conjunction with Harmonix and is distributed by MTV Games and Electronic Arts. The game was released in North America and Europe on June 9, 2009.

The core game is functionally similar to the note-matching gameplay of Harmonix's previous titles, Frequency and Amplitude, with the player responsible for playing all four instruments—lead and bass guitar, drums, and vocals—using the Portable's controls. Game modes are similar to Rock Band's, and the soundtrack includes a number of songs that have already been a part of the Rock Band series. Additional tracks will be a time-limited exclusive to Unplugged before they are released as downloadable content for the console games. The game supports the addition of new songs that can be purchased through the PlayStation Store.

Rock Band Unplugged, in addition to being released separately, was also released as part of a "Limited Edition Entertainment Pack" that also includes a Rock Band Unplugged-branded PSP, a 4GB memory card, and a voucher to download the movie School of Rock. A voucher for an exclusive 5-song demo of "Rock Band Unplugged" that is compatible with downloadable content is included with the PSP Go.</Overview>

    <Overview>The Dorm Guardian vs. The School Guardian
Inaba Tooru has always dreamed of living a co-ed life. That’s why, when he finally managed to transfer into the renowned Rintoku Academy, he immediately fell head over heels for two Sakuras!

Sakura Nanako’s classes are strict, but at home, she turns into an overbearing mother.

Kirishima Sakura may seem cold and unfriendly, but she is always ready to lend a helping hand as the class representative.

These two girls are outwardly indifferent to Tooru, but put the three of them together and sparks begin to fly.

In the sakura-colored season of spring, two fussy Sakuras have been caught in a light-hearted love triangle.


The Internet Friend vs. The Childhood Friend
"You know how romance games always give the main character that best friend who tells him about the girls? I want to be that guy."

Fuse Naoki, the self-proclaimed best friend, is always ready to tease Tooru about his situation with the two Sakuras.

But, unbeknownst to him, he is one side of yet another light-hearted love triangle.

Nitta Akira has been Naoki's friend since before they could read and write, and is now finally living under the same (dorm) roof as him.

Tachibana Kurumi used to be Naoki's MMO raiding partner, but they were separated before she ever got a chance to meet him in real life or tell him how she felt.

"I understand him better than anyone else."

Akira and Kurumi have Naoki stumped for the first time in his life. And so, Tooru finally gets a chance to see things from the other side.

The curtains rise on this desolate showdown for love.</Overview>

    <Name>Samurai Dou Portable</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2008-09-18T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>As in the original game, Way of the Samurai Portable tells the story of a wandering samurai who becomes drawn into a vicious power struggle between three opposing factions, each trying to seize control of a small region known as Rokketsu Pass. By interacting with members of each faction, the player can directly influence the structure of the story, and the game's overall length, as they work towards one of six endings.

At the game's core is a complex sword-fighting system, where stance, blade type/condition, and movement all play an equal part. Though primarily an action game, Way of the Samurai is as much about negotiation and politics, as it is about sword duels.

Though more or less a direct port of the PS2 original, some changes have been made to the control scheme, to facilitate the move to a new platform, while a moderate reduction in graphic fidelity is noticeable when the two versions are compared. No significant additions or changes have been made to in-game content.</Overview>

    <Name>Samurai Warriors: State of War</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2006-03-07T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Samurai Warriors: State of War (激・戦国無双, Geki Sengoku Musou) is a portable version of Samurai Warriors, however, it is not a straight conversion. It is more like Dynasty Warriors for the PlayStation Portable, giving it an "Empires" style of playing.

The gameflow is mainly separated into two stages: the Strategy phase and the Action phase. During the first stage, the map is separated into colored squares and the player is asked to move their character in a turn-based fashion. Terrain affects how the player can act during this stage. What usually follows is the action phase, which asks the player to defeat as many opponents possible within 60 seconds. These stages can tip the battle in the player's favor.

There are four main armies for the player to participate in: the Takeda (Western), Uesugi (Eastern), Nobunaga, or the solo army. Completing the game with these four factions unlocks the final stage in the game. It guest stars characters from Dynasty Warriors 4. The game features a Story mode, Free mode and VS mode.</Overview>

    <Name>SD Gundam G Generation Overworld</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2012-09-27T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>In the prequel "G Generation World" all the Gundam universes get thrown into a blender thanks to what is known as the Generations System, essentially a master computer that controls all of time and space, and thanks to it going haywire, all the Gundam universes are bleeding into each other.

Overworld picks up after World, where various different factions tried to destroy Earth (where the "World Signal" of the Generations System comes from) and failed. In fact, we find out why in this game, as the security system of the Generations System got corrupted and broke the system, causing time and space to go batshit.

In the meantime, all the Gundam Universes are essentially forced into a forever war in which events from their own canons bleed into other canons and they are effectively trapped in this cycle until the World Signal quits screwing up reality. Until then, death is uber cheap and everyone who dies just keeps getting brought back for another round of crazy crossover insanity.</Overview>

    <Overview>Having lost his love, job, hopes, and even most of his youth, Yoshimura Osamu (28) uses the last of his money at the local pub and aimlessly wanders the streets.

Yet in this moment of utter hopelessness, the strikingly attractive woman -- who had been at the center of attention back in the pub -- approaches Osamu on the street in an attempt to cheer him up.

Sensing that fate itself could be at play in their encounter, Osamu resolves to confess his feelings to the older woman, but...

"Come visit me if you ever find yourself in trouble."

Learning that she runs an apartment complex in a prestigious district of the city, Osamu follows the address he had been given and arrives at the "Terrace House Hinosaka", a run-down boarding house.

But once there, he meets not Honoka, but a girl young enough to be her daughter... who, in fact, is her actual daughter, Hinosaka Mitoko (height: 144cm).

Osamu finds out that while he was busy contemplating fate and his own feelings, Honoka had found another man and eloped, leaving the boarding house to her daughter and a group of eccentric tenants.

And so this tall, jobless, well-educated, and allegedly young man starts his life anew under the same roof as an admirable, hard-working, but vertically challenged girl who vehemently objects to the final part of that description.

Already overwhelmed by his eccentric new neighbors, Osamu finds himself fending off the inexplicable approaches of a co-worker at his new workplace, opposing the nefarious machinations of a wealthy young woman living nearby, and uncovering the truth about Mitoko's homeroom teacher: a woman with a penchant for wearing black stockings.

Where will our protagonist, who had unwittingly made bedfellows with misfortune, end up by the conclusion of this story?</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2010-01-26T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Set in a fictional German town named Lebensbaum (Life's Tree), Shadow of Memories revolves around a 22-year-old man named Eike Kusch, who dies in the beginning of the game from being stabbed after leaving a small diner. However, he is resurrected by Homunculus (voiced by Charles Martinet in English), a djinn or genie, who offers to send him back in time to prevent his death and gives him the time-traveling digipad. Eike explores four eras—2001, 1980, 1902 and 1580—as he attempts to unmask his killer and figure out a way of stopping his own murder at various points in the present. Along the way he encounters several characters: Dana, a modern-day waitress whom he accidentally brings back to the year 1580 and loses; the present-day fortune teller, who tells Eike the hour of his death; Eckart Brum, the curator of a private art museum who lost his wife and infant daughter in a shooting; Dr. Wolfgang Wagner, an alchemist living in 1580 with his wife, Helena, and their two children, Hugo and Margarette; and Alfred Brum, the great-grandfather of Eckart.

Given a red stone by Dana, Eike follows the Homunculus' instructions to give the stone to Wagner. Time-traveling ten days later, Eike discovers that the result of Wagner's experiment destroyed the lab and caused Hugo, already upset by his mother's death due to a lingering illness, to build a time machine and track Eike down with the intent of killing him. Depending on the player's actions, Hugo holds either Margarette or Dana hostage in the present and plans to use the red stone, revealed to be the Philosopher's stone, to resurrect his mother.</Overview>

    <Name>Shaun White Snowboarding</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2008-11-14T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Shaun White Snowboarding gives the player, as the title suggests, a snowboard and sends him off to four ski run locations around the world (Europe, Alaska, Japan and a fictitious location called Park City) under the watchful eye of professional snowboarder Shaun White himself as well as other professionals, moderators, pilots and such. But before the player can go on the slope, he has to create his character by choosing not only from different body looks but also from different clothes and snowboards.

During the course of the game the player earns money by completing the challenges which can in return be invested in more stylized clothes and additional types of snowboards. Each of the boards has six stats like balance or speed and not all of them are the best possible option for every given situation. While in a race speed is an important factor, a board with a higher rating in rotation allows for better stunts.

The game puts the player in an open world with him free to roam around the slope as he pleases. Several lifts and even a helicopter bring him to different starting locations but if he wants, he can also walk and discover hidden areas by doing so. By doing tricks, with controls using mainly the analog sticks similar to Skate, the player earns respect points. And on the track are, besides many obstacles to perform tricks on, challenges like the Jibfest, in which only tricks on rails and boxes count or Freestyle in which every trick counts. Others include the Death Race, in which the player needs to get to the goal before everyone else but as the name suggests, everything is allowed including ramming opponents and throwing snowballs to get them off-balance. There are also some challenges like King of the Hill that can only be done with at least one other human player joining in.

The multiplayer mode is basically an extension of the single player experience. Everything that is available in single player, can also be done with other players online or over LAN. The other players are also just dropped into the open world with the freedom to just do what they want on the server.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2010-03-11T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Shin Sangoku Musou Multi Raid 2 (?·???? MULTI RAID 2) is the sequel to Dynasty Warriors: Strikeforce. The game features an original story with several fantasy elements. Shi Huangdi, a tyrannical ruler with mystical powers, has been revived. With the power to resurrect old heroes and gods at his command, he desires to create an eternal empire for himself. The heroes of the Three Kingdoms band together to stop him.

A high-definition revamp called Shin Sangoku Musou Multi Raid 2 HD Version has been announced for the PlayStation 3. Players of this title will automatically have the original game's pre-order content available and can join parties with PlayStation Portable players. Save data from the original title is compatible with HD Version. 

Like its predecessor,  this is a multiplayer-based game drawing from the Dynasty Warriors series, with significant changes to "musou awakening" or fury modes, and aerial combat. Rather than following the battles between the three nations of Shu, Wu, and Wei, the story of this version revolves around the resurrection of the first Qin emperor.

Like Strikeforce Special, officer cards can be applied to city and fields for player benefit, as well as the ability to bring AI officers as help in single player. Players can now create quests, this and general participation with other players creates "community points", leading to acquisition of rare items.</Overview>

    <Overview>Toono Sayo is a beautiful girl that lives with her older brother, Toono Touya, who is an author. Her brother tells her about his next story: ‘Shinigami to Shoujo’. He explains that it will be about a lonely shinigami and a girl, and their search for the most beautiful word that exists.

One day, when Sayo looked up at a clock tower that has long ceased to move, she met a man wearing strange white clothes. When she asked him who he is and why he is wearing such weird clothes, he told her that he has no memory of his identity and that the only thing he knows is that he is a shinigami. Sayo suggests that if he does not know his name, she'll give him one and named him ‘Ao’ (blue) after how similar the man’s eyes are to the colour of the sky.</Overview>

    <Overview>Shining Blade is a PSP action SRPG developed and published by Sega and released solely in Japan. Another entry in the lengthy Shining franchise, Shining Blade abandons the grid-based tactics RPG battle system similar to games such as Fire Emblem and Tactics Ogre in favor of one that deeply resembles Valkyria Chronicles, another series by the same development house. In particular, much like Valkyria Chronicles, Shining Blade's battles are conducted with a mixture of turn-based and real-time elements, with enemy and allied sides each getting individual turns, but with the specific actions within those turns otherwise unfolding in real time. Various other subsystems made famous by Valkyria Chronicles such as potentials, character-specific abilities that can be triggered under specific circumstances, also feature prominently under different names. Unlike Valkyria Chronicles, however, Shining Blade features a heavier emphasis on individual character growth, with party members levelling up individually like in traditional RPGs, rather than doing so in bulk along with other characters of the same class as in the case of the former.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2007-05-15T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The Frog King has died and Shrek has inherited the throne. Since Shrek's not a big fan of this idea, he and his friends journey to the Worcestershire academy to recruit Fiona's cousin, Artie, for the job. Unfortunately, while he's away the dastardly Prince Charming has big plans to take over the kingdom.

SHReK the THiRD is an action-platformer with a heavy emphasis on brawling and humor. With plenty of Prince Charming's goons in his path (including black knights, evil gnomes, a crooning Captain Hook, and giant walking trees), Shrek will have to use all of his abilities to defeat them, find his way home, and pick up some souvenir mugs along the way.

Each level features several quests, lots of collectibles, and funny situations. While most of the levels feature Shrek himself, there are six playable characters in total (Donkey, Puss in Boots, Fiona, Artie, and Sleeping Beauty feature as well), over 20 levels, three big boss battles, and several multiplayer minigames.</Overview>

Commanders guide a two-man team across multiple terrain types as they strive to build "command equity" and "local influence" through successful stealth and tactical operations. By rescuing civilians, completing goals, and uncovering bonus objectives, players will earn points to spend on weapons or military support in the form of supply drops and air strikes. Black market equipment and intelligence can also be acquired from the local populace, improving the SEAL team's chances for success.

An entry in the SOCOM series wouldn't be complete without multiplayer options, and Fireteam Bravo 2 includes wireless support for up to 16 players in both Ad-hoc and Infrastructure modes. Three new game types are introduced in this sequel, including a capture-the-flag variant, and users are now able to create custom tournaments, ladders, and even clan challenges. Fireteam Bravo 2 also offers an improved friends list and instant messaging to help simplify the process of finding worthy teammates and opponents. As in the first PSP title, Fireteam Bravo 2 lets owners of the PS2 version link the two games to unlock special features in both SOCOM titles.</Overview>

    <Name>SOCOM: U.S. Navy SEALs: Tactical Strike</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2007-11-06T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Tactical Strike is the third hand-held game in the long-line of the SOCOM series. This one differs from its console cousins. Not only can the player choose to control a squad of US Navy Seals, but the player can alternatively decide to control one of several foreign units that have roles comparable to the SEALS, such as the Dutch KCT, German KSK, Australian SASR, the Italian 9th Parachute Assault Regiment, the Spanish UOE, the British SAS, the French GIGN or the South Korean 707th Special Mission Unit.

The story takes place in Panama, as the players national ambassador and the Panamanian ambassador are seized by a local group of rebel narcotrafficante kidnappers, referred to as "La Mano Los Gente" -- though it is worth noting that this is egregiously ungrammatical Spanish, since it would translate literally as "The Hand The People," because the "de" is missing! The fictional group of criminals, with their comical name, hold the pair for ransom and it is up to the player to conduct an increasingly complex and difficult operation in order to rescue the two diplomats.

The gameplay is different from other SOCOM games, in that there remains a squad of four men to control, but instead of bringing up a menu interface and then pointing the cursor to a certain location to give an order, this new game features a locator box that is moved along the surface of the ground. This lets the player choose a specific target location or rally point as the case may be, and then to use a certain button to instruct soldiers to take cover, establish crossfire, defend, ambush, etc. One can, of course, order them to use particular weapons such as close combat knives, rifles, satchel charges for demolition, pistols, a shot fired by the squad's sniper, or thrown grenades. When choosing an aimpoint to throw a grenade, a dynamically adjustable moving arc appears, to show what trajectory it will follow.

There are nine different non-linear missions to play, with the option of two instant action missions for each stage, and the story is told with pre-rendered cut-scenes.</Overview>

    <Overview>The Chao have disappeared and Sonic the Hedgehog and Miles "Tails" Prower immediately get on the case to find them. It turns out that Eggman Nega (once again masquerading as Doctor Eggman) has stolen the Chao and concealed them inside a haunted mansion. His plan is to feed them to an inter-dimensional beast called the "Ifrit" who needs to eat them to become invincible . After that, he plans to release the Ifrit into the world in order to destroy it. However, to open the portal to the Ifrit's world, the seven Chaos Emeralds are required. Eggman Nega secretly hires Rouge the Bat to collect the Chaos Emeralds. The Master Emerald has also gone missing (again) and Knuckles the Echidna teams up with Rouge to find it.
Meanwhile, Silver the Hedgehog has returned from a now ruined future caused by the Ifrit. In order to make a happier future, he searches for and steals the Chao that are left in order to hide them. Espio first thought that Silver was hiding Chao for a cause of evil, but Espio finds out that Silver was trying to save the world. Then, they work together to save the world. The real Dr. Eggman sends Metal Sonic to find Shadow, and tells him of Nega's plans. Nega has learned of the Ifrit by accessing Professor Gerald Robotnik's journals, and Shadow and Metal Sonic set out to retrieve the Chaos Emeralds before he does. Eggman uses Metal Sonic as a communication device to aid Shadow along the way.

All of the teams meet up at the Mystic Haunt Zone where the portal to the Ifrit's world is. Despite Rouge only collecting six of the Emeralds, the portal opens anyway and Nega dispatches his newly copy of Metal Sonic, Metal Sonic 3.0 to awaken the Ifrit. Despite possessing the minds of Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Rouge (depending on who the player plays as), the Ifrit is defeated by the other teams. Shadow and Metal Sonic defeat the Ifrit and close the portal but they and Eggman Nega are trapped in the Ifrit's dimension. However, Metal Sonic tears his chassis open, revealing the 7th Chaos Emerald. Shadow uses the Emerald to teleport back with Metal Sonic. Nega is left trapped under some rubble.

Sonic and Tails save all the Chao and bring them to a Chao Garden and relax there while Knuckles finds the Master Emerald in the Emerald Detector that he and Rouge stole from Eggman Nega. Rouge steals the Master Emerald and runs, and Silver returns to what he hopes is a happy future. Espio has to answer to Vector the Crocodile who has spent their client's advanced payment on late rental fees.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2010-05-10T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Tomoki Sakurai is a lad who lives in the quaint little town of Sorami. Life is quiet so Tomoki gets his kicks by being a peeping tom who has a number of prime viewing areas that he has mapped around town. Tomoki would be content to live this way forever, but one night a strange event changes his life forever. While watching the sky and waiting for two friends, from above an object falls from the heavens which turns out to be a female being known as an Angeloid. Her name is Ikaros and she sports a shock of pink hair, angel wings, and a large bosom. Ikaros bonds with Tomoki and takes him on a radical change of life experiences. The PSP game plies the interactive adventure trade which features a new story based on the animated source material. The dialogue is accompanied by speech for added ambiance. At the outset of the adventure, the somewhat mechanical song of the cicada signals the approach of summer. Once the warm weather arrives, the citizenry of Sorami visit hot springs, the beach, parks, and other locations that are amenable to lazy day lounging and sloth. It is within this backdrop that the cast of the PSP game interact, utilize card magic, and effect changes in the Angeloids that populate the adventure.</Overview>

    <Overview>Sora no Woto: Otome no Gojuusou is a Visual Novel developed by Compile Heart and published by XAX Entertainment Inc. based on the anime Sora no Woto. The game was developed and released for the PlayStation Portable in 2010. The game is a rather short, really light-hearted comedy and slice of life and it does not actually have a great deal of plot, but it adds a couple of things to the story of the animation. A lot of the game, especially in the first half, is fanservice material, but the game, subjectively, delivers if you're already a Sora no Woto fan.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2008-06-17T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The pixelated aliens are back to celebrate their 30th anniversary!

Taking a cue from other recent arcade classic updates, Space Invaders Extreme takes the gameplay of the 1978 classic, and reinvents it, giving power-up blasters, boss aliens, and an electronic soundtrack that plays in sync with the onscreen action.

Basic gameplay remains the same: Players guide a ground based cannon either left or right, blasting an oncoming fleet of invaders before they reach the ground. The main objective is to get as many points as possible before running out of lives.

Space Invaders Extreme introduces new elements, such as invader fleets that break pattern from their left to right descent, boss aliens that require several hits to destroy, power-ups that enhance the cannon, allowing the player to wipe out multiple invaders at once, while racking up combos.

Wi-Fi play is also possible, allowing player to team up cooperatively, or compete against the other. The Nintendo DS version also has a feature for online ranking.</Overview>

    <Name>Spider-Man Web Of Shadows: Amazing Allies Edition</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2008-10-21T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Spider-Man: Web of Shadows - Amazing Allies Edition is a 2D side-scroller with 3D graphics. The story is similar to the seventh-generation console versions. A break-off piece of Venom's symbiote begin infecting New Yorkers and it is up to Spider-Man to save the city. He can switch between the back and red suits at any time, which each have their own move set and abilities.

As Spider-Man defeats enemies, he is given skill points which can be used to purchased boosted stats and new moves. These are separate for each costume. In general, red focuses on agility and black on brutality. In order to purchase moves you must have not only the necessary points, but sufficient reputation. Throughout the game, you have conversations with other characters where you are given red, black or neutral choices. Answering red or black will build that suit's reputation, as will various other actions throughout the game.

You can take five power-ups into each level. These can be special abilities, such as temporary invincibility, or the eponymous allies. When summoned, they appear on screen and do their specific type of damage, then disappear. Allies are unlocked by beating bosses. The red suit unlocks hero allies like Luke Cage and Storm and the black suit unlocks villain allies like Galactus and Hobgoblin.</Overview>

    <Overview>Vertigo is a mix of the concepts of Marble Madness and the Monkey Ball series, but set in a futuristic environment. Players need to guide a shiny ball dubbed a xorb through high-tech environments at a high speed. The tracks are narrow and it is easy to drop off at any time, so precise steering is needed.

Games can be played in an arcade mode with forking paths or in a career mode where new tracks are unlocked gradually. Courses are time-limited and set in very different environments. Checkpoint allow the player to respawn at certain sections. While playing, power-ups can be collected to access air brakes and other bonuses. The xorbs can be completely customized in terms of colour. Other game modes are time trial, three multiplayer modes and a bowling mini-game. In certain game modes the xorbs can be armed with weapons such as rockets and missiles, which also deform the xorb when taking damage.</Overview>

    <Name>Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-11-03T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Star Wars Battlefront: Elite Squadron is a third-person shooter video game, part of the Star Wars: Battlefront series released November 3, 2009 on the Nintendo DS and PlayStation Portable.

Gameplay
Elite Squadron allows players to participate in combat on foot, in ground vehicles or in space. Players are also able to enter capital ships and, once the shields are down, fight the enemy inside on foot. The ground-space transitions are accompanied by short cutscenes while the game loads the next area. The same is also true of entering or exiting a capital ship. This is the first Battlefront game to allow players to fly from ground to space battles. The consequences of each battle will depend on the players actions, meaning that each individual enemy killed can affect the outcome of a result. The battlefront will not be one giant, seamless map, but a compilation of inter-connected, smaller size areas, each one capable of affecting the other.

Elite Squadron features "Heroes and Villains" gameplay.
It includes playable characters such as Luke Skywalker, Boba Fett, Darth Vader, Darth Maul, The Emperor and Kit Fisto, and the Heroes and Villains mode (Assault Mode) last featured in Star Wars: Battlefront II. Pre-release screenshots also show that General Rahm Kota, a character from Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is playable, as well as other characters from Renegade Squadron, such as Col Serra. The Heroes and Villains mode is displayed quite conveniently after a demo had been released on the PlayStation Network. Other game modes have been implied, with a focus on multiplayer, such as a deathmatch mode. Also, the Galactic Conquest mode, has undergone an enhancement on the PSP. In Galactic Conquest, two players are able to share a single PSP, and compete against each other in a strategy based game mode. PSP Players are able to mix elements from the Star Wars saga and put them into locations and situations that never happened, allowing for full customization. The story mode has been called "a huge step up from previous story modes", and was praised for incorporating the controls into the mission. It was also revealed that making progress in the story, and completing objectives, was the way to unlock customization props.</Overview>

    <Name>Star Wars the Clone Wars: Republic Heroes</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-10-06T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Star Wars: The Clone Wars - Republic Heroes bridges the gap between season one and two of the animated TV series. In the game the player learns more about the mysterious bounty hunter Cad Bane and hunts down the all-new Skakoan super villain Kul Teska in a gameplay style very similar to Lego Star Wars.

The game is fully built around drop in/drop out-coop for two players. This means each mission in this 3rd-person-action-adventure features two famous characters from the TV series including Obi-Wan Kenobi, the padawan Ahsoka and Captain Rex but separated by class. The players either control commandos or Jedi characters - never both mixed as they have totally different abilities and limitations. If no second player is available, the AI will automatically take over the second character and help overcome the many obstacles waiting ahead - mostly in form of several different kinds of separatist droids. While the players can use their lightsaber or blaster to fend them off, the Jedi characters also have the ability to ride the droids by jumping onto them from behind. This is not only useful to blast through enemy lines but is also used to solve specific riddles preventing the characters from moving on. In addition the droids can be forced to dance with every other droid on the screen following his lead making them defenseless. These dances are unique for each droid and need to be bought first in the shop. Also available there: funny masks and combat upgrades like stronger blasters or a more powerful force-push.

To buy these things, the players have to unlock them first and then need to invest points which are gained by killing enemies as well as by successfully completing missions or the mini-games. These mini-games are scattered around the levels and turn up once a specific section has been completed. They mostly involve killing as many enemies as possible in a short amount of time. Each kill in succession both during normal gameplay and the mini-games also ranks up the multiplier adding even more points to the account. Once a player dies, he will respawn at the nearest checkpoint either immediately if he plays alone or after the second player has reached one - both times without any penalties.</Overview>

    <Name>Star Wars: The Force Unleashed</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2008-09-16T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Star Wars: The Force Unleashed is a LucasArts action-adventure video game and part of the The Force Unleashed project. It was initially developed for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Wii, and Xbox 360 consoles and on the iOS, second-generation N-Gage, Nintendo DS, PlayStation Portable, and Java-equipped mobile phone handhelds.

The game was released in North America on September 16, 2008, in Australia and Southeast Asia on September 17, and in Europe on September 19. LucasArts released downloadable content for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 consoles. An Ultimate Sith Edition of the game, containing new and all previously released expanded content, was released in November 2009, which also came out on Mac OS and Microsoft Windows.

The project bridges the first two Star Wars trilogies, acting as an origin story for both the united Rebel Alliance and the Galactic Civil War depicted in the Original Trilogy. The game introduces a new protagonist, "Starkiller", as Darth Vader's secret apprentice, who is tasked with hunting down Jedi while killing rebels and Imperials alike in order to hide his existence from the Emperor, but soon starts to slowly redeem himself to the light side of the Force.

Reviews offered fairly positive response, praising The Force Unleashed for its compelling story, robust physics, impressive art and soundtrack, while some more negative reviews cited frustrating gameplay. Despite this, the game was a bestseller in the United States and Australia, with over one million copies sold its debut month. As of February 2010, the game has sold over seven million copies, and it is the fastest-selling Star Wars video game. A sequel, Star Wars: The Force Unleashed II, was released in October 2010.</Overview>

    <Name>Strikers 1945 Plus Portable</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2007-07-27T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Strikers 1945 Plus is a port of the classic Neo-Geo arcade game. Unlike other games in the series, this is the first time the game is officially available outside of arcades.

This game is a remixed version of sorts which includes elements from the two previous games in the series, Strikers 1945 and Strikers 1945 II. There are six different planes to choose from (plus one secret one), each with their own attacks and special moves. Player weapons are weak to begin with, but firepower is improved (and secondary missiles gained!) by capturing Power-Ups. Super bombs can also be picked up, which destroy or damage any enemy or boss that is near the explosion.

There are also special moves which are obtained by charging up a gauge on the side of the screen. The more damage inflicted upon the enemy, the faster it fills up. Once the gauge is completely full, hold down the attack button for an instant to unleash the special attack. Several special shots can be held in reserve and used when necessary.

A new addition to the PSP version is an Endless Mode, which allows game replay with an enhanced difficulty immediately after the final boss is defeated.</Overview>

    <Name>Sunday vs. Magazine: Shūketsu! Chōjō Daikessen</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-03-26T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Sunday vs Magazine is a crossover fighting game featuring dozens of characters from two of Japan's most popular shonen manga magazines: Shogakukan's Shonen Sunday and Kodansha's Shonen Magazine. It is a cel-shaded locked-view fighting game much like Street Fighter IV, and includes more than a dozen characters from each publisher's catalog, including contemporary series as well as older classic titles.

The game features three main modes. First, there is arcade mode, which pits the player against seven randomly-selected characters in order. Next is quest mode, which plays more like a scrolling beat-em-up and tasks the player with fulfilling various time-limited objectives like destroying targets or collecting keys, and which can be played solo or with up to three friend in wireless co-op. Last is the free battle mode, where the player can play a free battle against the computer or a friend via local wireless play.

The game system is relatively simple; characters have a limited set of moves, but they can be customized per character. Each character can also be upgraded using orbs earned in quest mode to buy new moves. In addition to regular moves, each character also has special super moves, which require use of a special bar which fills as the player lands blows. The player also unlocks assist characters as the game is played, which can be assigned to characters to give special assist moves. 

There is also a database mode where the player can read introductions for each of the playable and assist characters. The full list of featured series are as follows.

    <Name>Super Danganronpa 2: Sayonara Zetsubou Gakuen</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2012-07-26T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Like its predecessor, Super Danganronpa 2 is a murder-mystery visual novel with action elements. The player character this time is Hajime Hinata, a new student at the elite Hope's Peak Academy. On his first day at the Academy, his class meets Usami, a pink rabbit who dresses like a magical girl and introduces herself as the students' teacher. She transports the kids to Jabberwock Island, an uninhabited tropical paradise, tells them that they are now on a class trip, and instructs them to befriend one another and collect hope fragments. But just as the students are getting used to their bizarre new situation, the sadistic Monokuma appears and throws them into a game of life and death.

Once again, the Hope's Peak students can only escape the island if one of them is able to murder a classmate without being caught. Once a murder takes place, a class trial will be held to decide the guilty party. If the murderer is not correctly decided upon, that student will be able to leave at the cost of everyone else's lives. However, if the students do find the culprit, that single person will be messily executed in an elaborate display.

The game is divided into six chapters, which are further broken into Daily Life and Deadly Life segments. In Daily Life, the player can engage in Free Time conversations, in which Hajime gets to know his classmates by selecting the correct options in their dialogue trees. Completing Free Time awards Skill Points that can be spent for various beneficial abilities during trials. This part of the game also includes exploration of Jabberwock Island and scripted scenes. Once a murder has been committed, Deadly Life begins, and Hajime must scour the island for evidence during the Investigation. When all evidence has been collected, the game switches to the Class Trial, a fully-voiced set of cutscenes and action-oriented minigames. The player must then use both their reflexes and logic to present the correct evidence, debate with other students, and draw the conclusions that will expose the true murderer.

An alternate mode called Island Mode is unlocked after beating the main game. It presents an alternate universe in which Monokuma does not sabotage the class trip, and the students collect the hope fragments as per the original plan. Free Time conversations may also occur in this game mode, as well as brand-new scenes for each character.</Overview>

She's been invited to the opening day ceremonies, and is looking forward to a day of fun and excitement when suddenly Count Hogstein - a villain as corpulent and cliche as he is evil - blows up the Ferris wheel, takes the park management hostage, and declares the beginning of a deadly series of games. Desperate to save her uncle, Saki volunteers to be one of the participants in Hogstein's games, and finds herself thrust into the midst of excitement very different from what she'd expected when she woke up that morning. She'll need all of her cunning, determination, and exceptional insight to get herself and her fellow participants - all available bachelors - out alive and maybe, with a little luck, find love along the way.</Overview>

    <Overview>Assume the role of Gabe Logan, a highly-trained Precision Strike Operative, commanding a black box United States Agency that legally doesn't exist. Gabe finds himself dealing with a beautiful woman from his past who harbors a shocking secret while he battles the Red Section, a para-military group in possession of Project Dark Mirror, a next-generation weapon of mass destruction. Using Precision Strike Tactics, advanced vision technology, and the latest in high-tech weaponry, Logan and his team perform surgical strike missions - too sensitive for a military response, too dangerous for civilian intelligence forces.

Once inserted, Logan is his own authority - he must make life and death decisions, quickly choosing which course of action to take.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2011-06-14T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Portable DX (Deluxe) comes 5 whole years and 6 Nintendo console releases after the release of the last PSP Taiko, Portable 2. The total number of initial songs is 70, and with the additional downloadable songs thereafter (like every Taiko PSP has done), it matches the massive songlists introduced on the Wii. Like the other recent games, the songlist has become a lot more geared towards Namco Originals. 
		 
Portable DX is also the first console Taiko to show the total number of drumrolls made in the song, and the second console Taiko game to introduce the all new Ura Oni difficulties. Other new mechanics in the game include organizing almost all unlockables in the game into an Achievement list, and a mode called Medley Mode, in which three, five, or eight different songs are put together and played all at once. Two new gameplay modifiers were also added into the game, which randomize the notes to different degrees. The Bell note has been removed from this release and the vestigial function of the analog stick is to produce sounds for fun. (http://taikotime.blogspot.ca)</Overview>

    <Name>Taikou Risshiden IV</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2006-08-31T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The name of the game roughly means "the Taikō's success story". The characters are taken from the Momoyama period in Japan. In the previous Taikō Risshiden IV, a character was selected from the choices of a samurai, a ninja or a merchant. In Taikō Risshiden V, new roles include a blademaster, a pirate, a doctor, a tea master, and a blacksmith, counting eight roles in total. The player meets various historical figures of the era in the game. 

The game follows the card system used in Taikō Risshiden IV, with new profession added. A number of playable warlords are expanded for each version as 800 for Windows and 860 for the PlayStation 2. Non-combat characters include foreign missionaries, monks, and wives of the military lords. There are four overseas bases where pirates and merchants can travel to: Naha (Ryukyu, now part of Japan), Busan (Korea), Ningbo (Ming China), and Luzon (in the Philippines).

The military commander graphics were changed from the manga style of version III and IV to a graphic novel, or gekiga style, adopted from the format employed in a title named Nobunaga's Ambition. While each internal affairs and training sessions were settled in mini-games in Taikō Risshiden IV unless you change option in PlayStation 2 edition or later, in this version it is possible to opt out and skip those mini-games. However, when the player skips those mini-games, technical points will not be gained on ability score, and there are events that the player is challenged with the mini-games, even when opted to skip them. Like the previous PlayStation 2 version, players on Windows will gain new mode by the number of cards gained during the play. The function to edit warlord data is employed when all docks are collected, to replace the Power Up Kit used in other Koei titles.

When creating a special commander or warrior, the player designs the appearance for instance choose and arrange face features, props and clothing, not that to choose from among preset outlook. It is in this version that a female warlord can be chosen for the first time, as well as the player being able to register and maneuver up to 40 characters along with the main warlord at the same time.</Overview>

As a last resort, the world's life-giving tree (the World Tree) uses the last of its power to create a defender - the player's own character. The hero, after being awakened by a strange creature named Mormo whose own world was destroyed by the same threat, learns of the danger to this world's World Tree. Upon hearing a scream, the player rushes to discover that a girl is being attacked by a soldier. After rescuing the girl, she introduces herself as Kannono, a member of an organization named Ad Libitum. This guild seeks to help the people of the world, fighting injustice and oppression. With no better leads, the player and Mormo set out to join Ad Libitum, hoping to learn more about the location of the devourer.</Overview>

    <Overview>Telly Addicts is a game for one or two people based on the UK TV series of the same name that was aired in the mid to late 1980's. The game follows the format of the television series in that there are six rounds of multiple choice questions all of which are based on old television programs, each correctly answered question scores a point and in the multiplayer game the player with the most points wins. The rounds in the game are: Screen Test - Here the player is presented with six TV screens from which they must select three. After each selection a picture is revealed and an associated TV trivia question is asked. Classic Clips - This shows a short video excerpt from a television program after which three related questions are asked. Spotlight Round - here we have five questions which must all be answered within ten seconds Reveal Round - This starts with a grainy picture that gradually becomes clearer, the clearer the tincture, however, the fewer points are scored. Guess The Year - The player is shown a picture and is asked a question such as "When did this first appear on TV?", as an aid they are given the decade and just need to select the appropriate year. This is then followed by a couple of related trivia questions. Randomiser - A spinner selects a category and the player must answer a related question. The game features the original presenter, Noel Edmonds who introduces each round and each question and, of course, clips and pictures from many UK and US TV shows.</Overview>

    <Name>Tenchu: Time Of The Assassins</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2006-07-23T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Tenchu: Time of the Assassins is a stealth-action game that is part of the Tenchu series. The plot is set in feudal age Japan, and revolves around a group of ninjas and assassins who get involved into the kidnapping of Lord Gohda's single daughter, Princess Kiku. The game's protagonists are Rikkimaru and Ayame (both ninjas of the Azuma clan, working for Lord Gohda), Rin (a renegade ninja of the Beniya clan), and Tesshu (a medical doctor who works as a hired assassin at night). All four characters' campaigns can be selected right from the start. Each character's campaign encompasses eight missions.

The gameplay is once again based on the stealth-action genre's fundamental premise of completing the mission goals with being discovered as few times as possible, since the player characters are hopelessly outnumbered by the enemy guards. When the player approaches an unsuspecting enemy from behind, he can perform a stealth kill, which kills the target instantly without risking a fight.

Mission objectives vary from getting to a certain location on the map, taking out a certain target, to escorting NPCs to a designated area. A distance sensor indicates how great the distance is between the player and the closest enemy, but not the direction in which the enemy is. It also shows whether the enemy is aware of the players presence. As usual for the series, the player is free choose between several weapons and gadgets, which he obtains as reward for completing mission. The better the ranking he receives after the missions, the more and better items he receives.

Gadgets include throwing knifes, poisonous rice, healing potions, smoke bombs, grenades and many more. Aside from these optional accessories the player always has a trusty grappling hook at his disposal, which can be used to climb houses and ledges.

The game also features a mission editor to create story-driven single player missions, as well as multiplayer missions. The multiplayer mode can be played competitively and cooperatively with 2 players.</Overview>

    <Name>Tengai Makyou: Daiyon no Mokushiroku: The Apocalypse IV</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2006-07-13T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>New Orleans, Louisiana, 1893. A boy named Rizing is exploring the surroundings of his hometown together with a couple of friends. They discover a mysterious old house, go inside, and discover what seems to be a mummy in a coffin. They don't realize that at this moment they unleashed a powerful demon into the world, and that this demon has already possessed the soul of one of the boys...

The Apocalypse IV is the first Tengai Makyō game that is set outside of the Japan-like country Jipang. Much like Jipang of earlier games, United States of the late 19th century is not in a historically correct environment in this game, but an alternate world populated by demons, Biblical figures, and deliberate clichés (cardboard Native Americans, pop culture references, etc). 

The gameplay largely follows the general Japanese RPG template and Tengai Makyō gameplay style in particular. As in the previous games, magic spells have to be sought out and acquired rather than learned or bought. A notable change is the absence of random enemies - all the enemies are visibly wandering on the world map or in the dungeons. Other gameplay additions include special attacks that can also performed by several members of the party as a combo, and obtaining money by selling trophies received in battles.</Overview>

    <Overview>The BIGS is an arcade-style baseball game that is less focused on the intricate details of the game and more on the actual gameplay, proven by the inclusion of power-ups and turbos during gameplay. All 30 teams from MLB and their stadiums are included, as well as their player rosters. Instead of a traditional season mode as in many other baseball simulations, in The BIGS there is a mode titled Rookie Challenge, where the player creates a ballplayer and tries to lead him and his team to the World Series. Another mode, Home Run Pinball, puts a hitter in the middle of Times Square, New York, with the aim to hit balls into windows and neon lights.</Overview>

    <Name>The Bigs 2</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-07-07T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The Bigs 2 is an arcade-oriented baseball game. During matches, the player takes the role of the active player, e.g. the batter, and tries to make a successful move. Successful actions fill up a power meter and when it is full, the player can unleash powerful abilities: Big Blast (an automatic home run when hitting the ball as batter) or Big Heat (a power pitch).

In contrast to the main console version, this version is more similar to the predecessor. The only change which has made its way into this version is the wheelhouse system which shows shows the high risk zones of each batter. Actually bringing a ball through these zones rewards a big hit to his overall effectiveness. The other additions like the Big Slam ability and new mini games are not present. The Become A Legend career mode is identical to the predecessor's Rookie Challenge.</Overview>

    <Name>The Elder Scrolls Travels: Oblivion</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2007-04-27T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The Elder Scrolls Travels: Oblivion is a cancelled action RPG in The Elder Scrolls series that was planned to be released for PSP, based on the main Oblivion game released for PC, Playstation 3 and Xbox 360 in 2006. The game was in development at Climax Group London (former Syrox Developments, from Kingston upon Thames, UK) with some help from Climax Group Los Angeles  in 2005 / 2006, with new characters, inventory system, combat system, levels and more features exclusive for this PSP version.

Because of the Playstation Portable hardware limitations, Elder Scrolls Travels: Oblivion was going to be a more linear game than the original Bethesda Game Studios version. There was a hub world which contained various vendors, NPCs and story characters, and player would have used a teleportation crystal to go to each of the explorable areas of the game.

However, the game was never released. There has never been any official reason given for its cancellation or even official confirmation that it was canceled. Bethesda Softworks has declined to speak on the matter.

On 17 May 2016, footage as well as copies of beta builds of the game from June 2006 and January 2007 were leaked. The footage was taken down by ZeniMax, but restored shortly after.</Overview>

    <Overview>The Eye of Judgment: Legends is a spin-off of The Eye of Judgment.

It is also possible to trade cards with other players through ad hoc mode and infrastructure mode.

For Legends a completely new, single-player story mode was created. The card game itself has the exact same rules as the original The Eye of Judgment.</Overview>

    <Name>The Legend of Heroes III: Song Of The Ocean</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2007-01-23T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Song of the Ocean is the third installment in Nihon Falcom's RPG PSP trilogy, a third remake based on the games in the early nineties. Despite the number 3 (as the third part of the Gagharv Trilogy), it is in fact a remake of the fifth title in the series, Umi no Oriuta. This part is a standalone story that takes place in the realm of Weltluna, which was once the center of an ancient civilization known as the Water Tribe, and the game closes the Gagharv trilogy. It draws upon a number of the conventions from the previous titles and provides 30-50 hours of gameplay.

You control Forto, who sets off on an adventure to locate a song left behind by a legendary composer. The game features an improved battle system, which allows you to change party members during battle. While you travel you will meet a variety of characters, of whom six will be able to join your party. The game also features an extra bonus if you have save data from either of the first two Legend of Heroes games on your memory card.

From time to time, you will come across areas where you can teleport to a special section. There, you can team up with characters from the previous games and go on optional adventures for experience, money, and items - an addition that rewards players who have been following the series from the beginning.</Overview>

    <Name>The Legend of Heroes: A Tear of Vermillion</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2005-11-15T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The Legend of Heroes is old-school JRPG with new-school sensibilities and graphics. The old-school elements of the game are its turn-based combat, linearity, long dialogue scenes, a digital pet system and lots of similar things that seem to date from the 1995-ish RPG era. There are no random fighting encounters however. In this game you control Avin in his search for his younger sister Eimelle. They were separated when their cathedral was raided by religious zealots.

A Tear of Vermillion is a remake of the Japanese PC game Legend of heroes IV: Akai Shizuku. The word Gagharv (in the Japanese title of the remake) refers to the chasm that separates the continent Tirasweel, where the games takes place, from the rest of the world. Improvements Bandai made for this remake are completely re-done 3D graphics, new battle interface, and quicker load times.</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2008-07-24T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The game plays similarly to its predecessors, a role-playing video game with turn-based battles, but this time enemies have affinities to the three higher elements of time, space and mirage. Other additions are the turn bonuses of "rush", allowing the player to take two actions at once, "guard", which nullifies any damage, "vanish", which makes a target disappear for a few turns, and "death", which gives the attack the effect of an instant death. Throughout the games' dungeons the player will find doors engraved with symbols of the moon, stars and the sun, which trigger, respectively, long story scenes, short story scenes, and mini-games. Those scenes usually tell the story of past events and may feature battles.</Overview>

    <Name>The Legend of Heroes: Zero no Kiseki</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2010-09-30T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The Legend of Heroes: Zero no Kiseki is a direct sequel to The Legend of Heroes: Trails in the Sky the 3rd and follows the story which starts several months after the events in that game. The story takes place in Crossbell City where light and darkness are together and places the player in a role of four lead characters, namely Lloyd Bannings, a rookie police investigator who joined the police in search of clues that will help him understand how his brother have died, Elie MacDowell, mayor's granddaughter who also joined the Crossbell police to help mend the current state of the city, Tio Plato, an employee of a leading company in orbal technology assigned to Lloyd's team, and Randy Orlando, a former member of the Crossbell State Guardian Force. Traversing the world in 3D isometric bird's eye perspective, utilizing on-screen mini-map, fighting monsters in random encounters, upgrading your characters and their stats, buying and trading weapons and items, using magic spells, and so on is very similar to that of previous installments in the series with occasional touch ups and minor changes here and there.</Overview>

    <Name>The Lord of the Rings: Aragorn's Quest</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2010-09-14T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The handheld and PlayStation 2 version of Aragorn's Quest follows the same story as the eponymous console version: the story of Aragorn during the War of the Ring is narrated by Frodo's friend, Samwise Gamgee, who recalls the story to entertain his children who want to know about the adventures of the one known as Strider. In this version, however, the hobbits are only seen in cutscenes, and has no gameplay in the Shire, that serves as the game hub in the PlayStation 3 and Wii version of the game.

In game, the player takes control of Aragorn who fights orcs, trolls and other enemies using both his sword and his bow. Aragorn can block, use quick or strong sword attacks and shoot arrows and charge his bow for more powerful attacks. He can also use a variety of special moves, many of which are acquired as the game progresses. Defeating foes replenishes some health, and gives experience points and morale. Aragorn's morale is depleted by using some special moves. As in most RPGs, gaining experience results in leveling-up, which improve Aragorn's stats and rewards the player with points to use to learn previously acquired special moves. Pieces of equipment such as swords and belts can be equipped to increase Aragorn's prowesses.

This version does not have cooperative play, but has an Arena mode.</Overview>

    <Name>The Lord of the Rings: Tactics</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2005-11-08T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The Lord of the Rings: Tactics is a completely original strategy game set in Tolkien's Middle-Earth. Players experience the entire trilogy, from the earliest battle at Weathertop to the final conclusion at Minas Tirith and Mordor.

Unlike other tactics games, which are strictly straightforward turn-based affairs, The Lord of the Rings: Tactics innovates in its system. Players assign their moves simultaneously with the AI, and then all the actions unfold. In this way, players must guess their opponent's intentions and try to block them before they actually happen. This keeps the action moving much faster than a traditional tactics game.

The game features over 24 levels and includes the vast majority of characters from the films, such as Aragorn and Gandalf, the hobbits, as well as key villains such as Saruman and the Balrog. Players can choose between good and evil campaigns, so the entire game can be experienced from each of their perspectives.

Characters can level up, gain abilities, and purchase equipment between levels, reminiscent of EA's The Third Age game. Since the battles are mostly small skirmishes, your characters' attributes and abilities (or lack thereof) can easily swing battles.

Finally, the game also offers a multiplayer skirmish mode for up to four players. Players purchase units and allies using a flexible point system, choose a battle location, and try to take out each other's teams.</Overview>

    <Name>Thexder Neo</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-10-01T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>During a routine survey, the interstellar weapons platform Laevina detects Nedium, an asteroid of unknown origin, and soon finds itself in the grip of the planetoid's ultramagnetic field.

    <ReleaseDate>2006-11-21T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Thrillville allows gamers of all ages to easily build and customize the coaster of your dreams. Gone are the days of the complex PC techniques used in other coaster games. Rather, Thrillville's easy to use building mode has been designed specifically for the console platforms and makes building all 75-plus rides from wooden, corkscrew and inverted coasters to merry go rounds, trains and carnival rides, easy, and most importantly, fun. Imagination is the only height limit with Thrillville, where the fun ranges from racing on go-kart tracks you put together and playing mini-golf on courses you designed to joining friends for dozens of four-player party games, from bumper cars to arcade shoot-'em-ups. You can also tour the park on foot - a first for theme-park titles - chatting and joking with all the guests to help them out and make sure they're enjoying themselves.</Overview>

    <Overview>Once, you were Suicide, the fastest rising star of the TNA iMPACT wrestling scene. You blew through some of the fiercest opponents; taking down AJ Styles, devastating Robert Roode, and destroying Booker T., but then... everything changed. The politics behind the ring got heated, and not in your favor. When you finally claimed the title, someone came for you. And now you're here. You've woken up in what appears to be a rundown hospital in Mexico, and you can't remember a thing; your name, what you do, and certainly not why you're here. Lost in a land that is not your own, you need to get back to America. You hear talk of a local wrestling match where the winner goes on to wrestle at a nearby American Air Force base. This is the best shot you've got at getting home. But once you're in the ring, something strange happens. Your body seems to remember what your mind cannot. Punches, grapples, throws, and stomps all come naturally, as if you were a seasoned professional... This is where your journey begins. Find your way home, remember who you were, and claim what was rightfully yours.</Overview>

    <Name>TOCA Race Driver 2: Ultimate Racing Simulator</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2005-09-01T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>TOCA Race Driver 2: The Ultimate Racing Simulator (V8 Supercars 2 in Australia, DTM Race Driver 2 in Germany) is a racing video game installment of the racing video game TOCA Touring Car series, released on Xbox and Microsoft Windows in April 2004, with a PlayStation 2 version following six months later.

Two PSP conversions were released in 2005 and 2006; the first being TOCA Race Driver 2 in Europe and Japan and the second being Race Driver 2006 in the US. The game continued to use a scripted career mode as introduced in the previous Race Driver game, but dropped the Ryan McKane character. Story-developing cutscenes were played out from a first-person perspective, with other characters never addressing the user by name (similar to the storytelling method of later Need for Speed titles). The Mobile phone version was released only in the U.S. a few months later.

The career mode offered a wider selection of championships than previous games, featuring the likes of Supertruck and Rallycross in addition to the traditional touring car formats. However, not for the first time in the series, the British Touring Car Championship was not included, yet the franchise continued to license the TOCA name in the title. In addition, online play was featured heavily, with support for up to 8 players on Xbox Live.

The PC version of the game features 31 licensed and fictional global race locations offering 48 tracks.[4] These include Hockenheim from the German DTM series and Surfers Paradise from the Australian V8 series. The PS2 version features an additional track, Catalunya.[5]

The PlayStation 2 version also allows up to 8 PS2 on-line players, without broadband Internet service being required, too.</Overview>

    <Name>TOCA Race Driver 3 Challenge</Name>
    <Overview>TOCA Race Driver 3 (also known as DTM Race Driver 3 in mainland Europe, V8 Supercars 3 in Australia, and TOCA Race Driver 3 Challenge in the PlayStation Portable version) is the third title of TOCA racing video game series, developed and published by Codemasters, and released in 2006. The game features several fully licensed championships, including the DTM series and V8 Supercar championship. This is the last in the series to have TOCA in its title as following on from this TOCA was dropped in favour of just Race Driver (e.g. Race Driver GRID).

It includes 120 Championships and 35 Types of Racing through the Championship in World Tour, Pro Career, and Free Race. Also it has Bonus Championships in different disciplines. They take place largely in the UK and Germany, though many more tracks are unlocked by winning cups in Pro Career, or by setting a lap time record on a course within Pro Career mode. Open wheel, GT, Oval racing, Rallying and Off-road racing were all featured, and can be raced in either a detailed Pro Career mode or an open-ended World Tour.

Online play allows 12 and 8 players on Xbox and PlayStation 2, respectively. Currently, it is the only racing simulator for PlayStation 2 with an online racing mode. It received good reviews, frequently being compared favorably to Gran Turismo 4 and Forza Motorsport, in the aspects of cars on track, collision and wear damage. Custom tuning of suspension components for handling and gear ratios, and including braking ratio front to rear. A more through tuning setup for a race car was allowable more so then in a driving simulator like Gran Turismo 4, since TOCA Race Driver 3 was a racing simulator.

The game features many real-life competitions, including British GT, DTM, IRL and V8 Supercars, as well as a Vintage series, other GT series, and Rally. The Formula Williams FW27 is the featured car of the Formula 1 series in the game.</Overview>

    <Name>Tokimeki Memorial: Forever With You</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2006-03-09T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Tokimeki Memorial (ときめきメモリアル Tokimeki Memoriaru?, lit. "Heartbeat Memorial") is a dating sim by Konami and the first game in the Tokimeki Memorial series.

The first game in the series is particularly notable for its "bomb" feature, where neglected, infrequently-dated girls would eventually become angry and gossip to their friends, severely reducing love meters across the board. In the middle of the game, when the number of known girls was high, these "bombs" became the primary concern of the player, forcing careful planning and strategies like round-robin dating. Although the feature was still present in the later games, it was considerably reduced in importance and the difficulty in avoiding it.</Overview>

    <Name>Tomb Raider: Anniversary</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2007-08-09T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Anniversary is a remake of the original Tomb Raider with a technically more advanced graphics engine. It has the same basic storyline, though some cutscenes and much of the dialogue within have been expanded or modified in other ways. Locations correspond to those of the original version and are accessed in the same order, but have been re-designed with different layouts and mostly completely different puzzles which allow implementation of new moves introduced in Lara Croft Tomb Raider: Legend: swinging on ropes and using a grappling hook at specific points.

Puzzles are generally more focused on acrobatics in this version, ledges being much more prominently featured as a level design element, requiring combinations of jumping and shimmying across them to access areas. This type of gameplay replaces the key-retrieval and block-pushing puzzles of the original almost entirely. Combat is similar to that of the first game, though the player must now manually activate targeting. Some boss fights have been made a separate enclosed stage rather than being part of the exploration as in the original version. These fights may have puzzle-solving elements and often require the player to use Lara's new "adrenaline dodge" ability, which slightly slows down time when the opponent charges at her while in an "enraged" state. Some cutscenes require the player to participate in quick-time events.</Overview>

    <Name>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2009-06-23T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen is a game based on the movie of the same name. Set a few years after the defeat of Megatron in the first game/movie, Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen reveals that the threat from the Decepticons has in fact, far from ended. Since the end of the first movie Decepticons have began popping up again all over Earth. They are in search of a mysterious object from space that will gift the balance of power.

The game is a linear third-person shooter that puts the player in control of many of the main characters from the movie, shifting between both Autobot and Decepticon factions. The storyline is told via cutscenes that also allow for the player to easily transition from one character to the other. Playable characters on the Autobot side include: Optimus Prime, Iron Hide, Jetfire, Bumblebee. The Decepticon side includes: Starscream, Sideways (a new character), and Megatron.

Though the game doesn’t allow transform wherever the player wants to, transformation has been introduced as special attacks during robot mode, as fixed alternate game modes (driving Shanghai tunnels as Sideways, and fly through the skies of Russia as Starscream) and, in both robot and vehicle modes, as special moves that give the player alternate abilities. For example, transforming as Starscream while flying will enable him to fly backwards as a robot to take out enemies behind the protagonist.

For multiplayer, at any point during a single-player campaign a friend can join in as a "Remote Weapon System", which allows them to shoot enemies, erect a shield to defend and transfer energon between both players.</Overview>

    <Overview>Transformers: The Game is the name of multiple versions of a video game based on the 2007 live action film Transformers, all of which were released in North America in June 2007. Home console and PC versions were developed by Traveller's Tales for the PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, Wii, PlayStation 3 and PC. A different PlayStation Portable version was developed by Savage Entertainment.

Transformers Autobots and Transformers Decepticons are the Nintendo DS versions of Transfomers: The Game. Vicarious Visions, who was tasked with bringing the adaptation to the Nintendo DS, chose to adapt the DS version into two separate games.[1] Autobots follows the heroes' perspective while Decepticons follows the villains'. Unlike games with multiple SKUs such as Pokémon which feature only minor differences between versions, these are two separate games, sharing some basic similarities, but with unique characters, missions and locations.[2]</Overview>

    <ReleaseDate>2011-01-27T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>“That is unacceptable now. You've known the secret.
There is a story of a boy who can see AYAKASHI, not visible to human eye.”

In the present world, crime rates keep on increasing every day. This is happening because evil spirits have crossed over from the spirit world to the human world. These spirits are invisible to the naked eyes. One day, Yūto Ishigami was pushed out of the third floor's window by a classmate who suddenly turned violent, but he miraculously survived without a single scratch. However, since that day, Yuuto began to see strange things. These strange things are known as "Ayakashi". The fact that he's seeing them is proof that the ability that was sleeping within him has been awakened.

As Yūto, the player will explore the school and look for objects that might be occupied by a spirit. Once the player finds an object that is believed to be possessed, the player can take a picture of it with the mobile phone. Each time the player takes a photo, 5 minutes of in-game time pass. During battles, the player can send an e-mail from the mobile phone with a particular picture attached to it to summon the respective spirit to aid Yūto.[2]

Tsukumonogatari emphasizes the "power of words" as part of its battle system. Yūto’s school is populated by several people, including his friends and the school staff themselves. The player can go around talking to different people at school, and engaging in conversation with them. Occasionally, they’ll narrate a proverb or a rumor or a myth to the player. These are "words".

Different "words" can be attached to spirits during battles to give them various abilities, and they are vital when battling against the Ayakashi. When a battle begins, the player will be able to summon a spirit and add up to a maximum of three "words" to it to decide what abilities it will possess in battle.</Overview>

    <Overview>An exclusive PSP edition of Capcom's legendary platforming game, directed by the original's creator Tokurou Fujiwara.

You start off with just a basic jump, but eventually gain a double jump and even the ability to fly. You'll also earn lots of magic spells along the way. The game promises a greater number of spells and weapons than ever before. New for Goku Makaimura is non-linear gameplay. You're no longer on a fixed path from start to end. The levels include branching points and even warp points. By using a warp point, you can warp back to previous levels and collecting items that you might have missed.</Overview>

    <Name>Umihara Kawase Portable</Name>
    <Overview>This game is a plaformer with a twist: you play a girl in an aquatic world, and the only way to fight against your enemies are your brain and a grappling hook, which you have to master if you plan on finishing this game. Because there are no power-ups. 

Your enemies are all sea creatures, but some of them have grown legs and now they can attack and chase you on land.

One of the exceptional things about this game is its replay value, absent in most platformers: you can finish the game and then play against your best time, try to find hidden paths or exits, or even record your best replays on the memory card.

This edition is a re-release of the original Umihara Kawase: Shun, also for the Sony PlayStation, released back in 1997. In terms of new content, new levels have been added, as well as several bugfixes, but it is essentially the same game as the first edition.</Overview>

    <Name>Unchained Blades</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2012-06-26T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Unchained Blades follows the story of the dragon emperor, Fang, who after being stripped of his powers by the goddess Clunea, embarks on a journey for revenge and to regain his true form. Arrogant and vengeful, Fang is joined in his quest by a cowardly golem prince, a shy medusa priestess, a young phoenix clan maiden, and many other mythical beings seeking to meet with the goddess.
In Unchained Blades, players journey through the game with a party of up to four characters, moving through dungeons in a first-person perspective and engaging in turn-based combat along the way. Using the game's unique "Unchain" system while in battle, players are able to try and convince monsters to follow them. If they are successful in using the Unchain system, the enemy monster will then join their party and help them in the future by blocking attacks or supplying players with special offensive abilities. Each character in the player's four person party can hold up to four unchained creatures, ensuring plenty of combat variety.</Overview>

    <Name>Uno </Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2010-04-22T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Uno is a conversion of the popular card game of the same name. The goal is to be the first player to get rid of all of your cards, but you have to shout out Uno! when you have one card left, or you have to pick up another one. Players take turns to play special cards that skip players, force players to draw additional cards, reverse the flow of the game, and so on. A card can only be placed on top of the pile if it is the same type of card, or if it is the same colour. If neither of these conditions occur, the player must pick up another card.

There are three different modes of play in Gameloft's version of Uno:

    Quick Play - selecting this begins a game of Uno immediately.
    Tournament - in this mode, you must beat your opponents in five rounds of Uno.
    Custom Game - this mode lets you play Uno however you play it normally. Many features are customizable, such as AI difficulty, scoring type, penalties, and how you draw additional cards.</Overview>

    <Name>Valkyria Chronicles 3: Extra Edition</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-11-03T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Senjō no Valkyria 3: Unrecorded Chronicles (戦場のヴァルキュリア3 Senjō no Varukyuria?), usually referred to as Valkyria Chronicles III, is a tactical role-playing game developed and published by Sega for the PlayStation Portable. It is the third game in the Valkyria Chronicles series and was released on January 27, 2011 exclusively in Japan. An expanded version of the game, subtitled Extra Edition was released in Japan on November 23, 2011.[2] The game features an opening song もしも君が願うのなら (Moshimo Kimi ga Negauno Nara?) sung by Japanese singer May'n.

Occurring in the same time frame as the first game, Valkyria Chronicles III is a side story that follows the exploits of an unwanted and castigated Gallian Army squad during the Imperial invasion of 1935.[3] Contrasting the previous games' bright outlook and recognition for their protagonists, Valkyria Chronicles III explores the themes of being outcast and the search for redemption. As described by its catchphrase, the game tells "The tale of nameless soldiers who, on the verge of despair, changed history."

The game was the first in the series to not officially be translated into English by Sega. However, an unofficial fan translation for the Extra Edition was eventually released in December 2013.</Overview>

    <Overview>The game's story takes place two years following the conclusion of Valkyria Chronicles, in which Squad 7 defeats Maximillian in Gallia and destroys the Marmota, ending the Second Europan War. A rebel group of dissatisfied aristocrats and like-minded soldiers and citizens calling themselves the Gallian Revolutionary Army begins a civil war to wage an ethnic cleansing campaign against Gallians of Darcsen descent.[11] However, with the intense fight against the Empire having left Gallia's regular army in an exhausted state, there is initially little to stop the insurrection from gaining momentum. Laws preventing the formation of a national militia to fight fellow Gallians force the government to deploy military academy cadets to the front lines in order to combat and defeat the GRA forces.</Overview>

    <Name>Viewtiful Joe: Red Hot Rumble</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2006-03-22T00:00:00-08:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>This game is different from the previous incarnations, whereas this one takes its gameplay from the Super Smash Bros. series. The game features the main heroes, Joe, Capt. Blue and Silvia, along with many others as well as a group of villains fighting each other in a series of battles in multiple environments, such as a construction site, a warehouse and a wrestling ring to name a few.

The story has Captain Blue getting ready to shoot a new movie, but has trouble deciding who will be the lead character, so he sets up a tournament of the heroes to determine it. The player takes control of one of the three heroes, battling a set of enemies, each stage having their own set objectives to complete in order to advance. There is also a party mode that can support up to four-different players in an all out brawl. Players can collect "VFX Orbs" throughout the fight, collecting enough will allow the player to use a VFX power on the opponent(s).

The PSP port is virtually the same same, but with added content exclusive to it, a single player Trial Mode, where the player competes in a series of mini-games, the ability to play as Dante from the Devil May Cry series and a game sharing feature that lets players play wirelessly using Ad-Hoc and play certain stages using only one disc.</Overview>

    <Name>What Did I Do to Deserve This, My Lord!? 2</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2010-05-10T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Become the God of Destruction! Build a thriving natural ecosystem, a twisting, tunneling dungeon underneath the earth, and fill it with hordes of terrible monsters to protect the evil overlord, Badman. Ensure that he is safe from armies of nasty humans, eager to ransack the place, steal your loot, and prevent Badman from taking over the world!

Holy Invasion of Privacy, Badman! is a strategy game in the vein of the Bullfrog game, Dungeon Keeper. Players use their pickaxe to dig deep into the earth to protect the villain, Badman, from harm. Their goal is to create monsters by digging up nutrient-filled blocks, which produce monsters. The more nutrients inside the block, the more powerful the monster is. By creating all sorts of powerful monsters, you'll increase your 'Battle Power', which indicates how powerful Badman's entire army is.

Players only have a limited amount of 'Dig Power' available. After this runs out, they cannot dig through the earth any more, and must rely on the monsters to take care of the dungeon. More Dig Power can be earned for each level by not using all the Dig Power you were given, or by earning bonus Dig Power at the end of the level.</Overview>

    <Name>Wild Arms XF</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2007-08-07T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Wild Arms XF is a 2D turn-based tactical role-playing game, creating a gameplay experience somewhere between Dungeons &amp; Dragons and chess. Players are given control of a small squad of characters (six or less) and placed on a grid-based map resembling a geographical location (a swamp, a town, a river), upon which they fight battles to progress through the game. As with most T/RPGs, positional advantage can be critical to victory, and players are encouraged to outmaneuver their enemies as well as outgun them. The game emphasizes positioning and maneuvering by the inclusion of "Formation Arts," which increase attack damage when an enemy is surrounded by your characters in a line, a triangle or a circle. Wild Arms XF is a member of the small subsection of T/RPGs whose battlefields are based around hexagonal tiles instead of squares. "Combination Arts" return from previous Wild ARMs titles, allowing characters to target an enemy in a waiting state and then deliver their attacks simultaneously with the next ally to attack their target. If the player succeeds in executing an uninterrupted series of commands, the damage inflicted upon enemies will increase significantly. On the other hand, the enemy gets the same advantage.</Overview>

The third game in the series was first released nine months later for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, and Xbox 360.

    <Overview>Being good at Pool is simply not enough in World of Pool. You have to be the best - and not just at Pool but also at the tactical game that is Billiards and the ultimate test of ball control, Snooker.

The stakes in World of Pool could not be higher. Go to another player’s house and see what takes your fancy – a nice new cue, a jukebox, or even a vase. Challenge your opponent and if you win the item is yours for your very own crib. But be careful, because if you lose your own crib is going to be raided. As losing is not an option its time to play dirty – taunt your opponent to distract them, soften the cushions so the balls don’t bounce – do whatever it takes to win.</Overview>

    <Name>WWE All Stars</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2011-03-29T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>WWE All Stars can be seen as a successor to WWF Wrestlemania: The Arcade Game. Unlike the simulation-based WWE SmackDown vs. Raw games, it offers a more arcade-oriented gameplay, featuring elements of fighting games, with over-the-top moves and unrealistic animation.

Similarly to versus fighters, the wrestling in the game is predominantly combo-based. The wrestler's signature moves are exaggerated, including nearly supernatural elements such as diving high into the air or slow motion moves. The game features popular WWE wrestlers from its time, such as Triple H, The Undertaker, Rey Mysterio, Big Show and John Cena, as well as WWF wrestlers from the past: Hulk Hogan, Bret Hart, The Ultimate Warrior, Jake the Snake and the "Macho Man" Randy Savage.

The game includes a Path Of Champions mode, where players can choose a WWE Legend or Superstar to either become the WWE Champion, the World Heavyweight Champion, or the WWE Tag Team Champions.</Overview>

    <Name>X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2005-09-20T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>X-Men Legends II: Rise of Apocalypse is an action role-playing game developed primarily by Raven Software and published by Activision. It is the follow up to 2004's X-Men Legends. It was first released in September 2005 for the GameCube, Microsoft Windows, N-Gage, PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable and Xbox video game platforms. It is set after the events of X-Men Legends and features the mutant supervillain Apocalypse as the primary antagonist.

The developers intended the game to have a greater sense of scale than its predecessor, and writers created a story where the villains known as the Brotherhood of Mutants would need to ally themselves with the heroic X-Men to defeat a greater threat. High quality cinematics were created by Blur Studio. Online multiplayer was also added.

The game was well received by gaming critics on all platforms. Critics felt that the inclusion of online play, additional mutant powers, and a larger cast made the game an improvement over its predecessor. Some reviewers were critical of the game's voice acting and felt that the gameplay was repetitive. It sold enough copies to be added to the budget line known as PlayStation 2's Greatest Hits.</Overview>

    <Overview>X-Men Origins: Wolverine will give you new insight into how much damage indestructible, razor-sharp claws can do to a human body. This is a game that revels in gore, with decapitations, eviscerations, and mutilations drenching the screen in blood. It may be derivative, a cakewalk, and at times buggy, but the sheer visceral impact of the over-the-top violence in X-Men Origins is enough to make it a fun action game, as well as one of the better movie tie-ins released recently.</Overview>

While reluctant to take a commission to collect the data onsite at first, he ends up coerced into agreement by the caller who blackmails him with something from Seiji's past which he was part of 15 years ago where he witnessed something he shouldn't have. On his way to the city, he ends up meeting his old friend, police detective Kaoru Saegusa who is working on a case involving a series of disappearances.

    <Name>Ys Seven</Name>
    <ReleaseDate>2010-08-17T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>The kingdom of Altago is rebuilding their kingdom around a newfound peace after years of war against the merciless armies of Romn. The classic adventuresome duo, Adol and Dogi, arrive in the harbor of Altago City, and quickly find themselves in a scuffle with the Dragon Knights, the kingdom's military police body, when attempting to save a local girl from harassment by one of their commanding officers. Upset by the interruption and subsequent humiliation, the commander arrests Adol and Dogi, charging them with espionage. 

The king of Altago, having known of the duo's pending arrival from an old trusted friend, quickly releases the pair from prison and summons them to his chambers. He tells the men about an ancient shrine that was uncovered after a recent earthquake, and asks for their help in investigating this mysterious new find. Adol and Dogi oblige, unaware that they are about to take the first steps on a long journey to save all of Altago from long-forgotten ancient forces, and to reunite the estranged five tribes who serve and protect the Five Great Dragons deified beings who may well be the world's last hope. 

Ys Seven is the latest installment in the long-running Ys series which first debuted on PC in 1987. This is the first iteration to be built specifically for the PSP system, taking full advantage of the widescreen format and hardware. The battle system consists of a three-member battle party with enemies engaged on the field map in real-time for fast-paced combat.

    <ReleaseDate>2009-04-23T00:00:00-07:00</ReleaseDate>
    <Overview>Players can choose to play as a boy (Naoki Kōsaka) or a girl (Rina Makimura), both of whom start the game trapped in a bus an underground tunnel after a large earthquake. Survivors the player can encounter include Saki Honjō, a nurse turned amateur musician, and Ayami Hazuki, a high school girl. The two player characters have slightly different attributes, which affect gameplay: Naoki is physically strong and self-confident, but becomes stressed more easily, while Rina is physically weak but has a calmer personality, which causes her stress levels to rise more slowly.[4]

During Zettai Zetsumei Toshi 3, the thirst and body temperature meter has been replaced by a stress meter. The meter rises after engaging in angry conversations and witnessing/experiencing various traumatic incidents.[5] The player can choose from several responses during conversations, allowing them to choose how to behave towards fellow survivors. These responses allow the player to control the character's personality, and also have occasional effects on the character, such as lowering or raising their stress levels. High stress will affect the character's movements, causing them to have trouble walking. The character's health meter will drop during hazardous situations, such as touching fire or remaining in the vicinity of a gas leak. The character's status bars can be replenished or reduced by consuming food and medicine, or completely restored by resting on a bench, which also allows the player to save the game.

A number of different outfits and compasses can be collected during the game.

2-4 players can play cooperatively via ad hoc connection, unlike the first two games, which were only single player.</Overview>
